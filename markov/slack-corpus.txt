I don’t have access to that second repo: <https://github.com/mediarain/adobe-livestream-publisher-dashboard> … I thought I had access to all mediarain repos… is that link still good?
Thanks!
So I’m trying to get this up and running…. funny thing is the github wiki is telling me to access the dashboard in order to get auth tokens…. but the dashboard being up is what I’m trying to help fix…. is it referencing another dashboard?
Okay - it just sounded like it might have been referencing another dashboard online or something where our account w/ Adobe was held
It’s this first bullet point I’m looking at… <https://github.com/mediarain/adobe-livestream-dashboard#configuration>
So my update for today was just that I’m getting into the program logic, but am not really able to test it out without solving the above question about access tokens
I was wondering who Elyse was :slightly_smiling_face:
Would you be able to get me access to the server that this is running on? I can grab the creds I need if I can ssh in or something.
Thanks !
On the server, I replaced all the code with a redirect to <http://samepicofdavecoulier.tumblr.com> … but only on production…. :slightly_smiling_face:
I only code on production. I like to live on the edge.
Seriously tho - thanks  … I think I have what I need at the moment, I just needed those token/urls to get setup on local
So… I’ve figured out the 3 lines that are causing an error with the livestreambuild. (They seem to be coming from a file named referrer-bubbles.js which uses the d3 library)… If I comment them out, the page loads w/ no JS errors (yay!)… but also no data.
I’m just at this weird place where I don’t know how to keep troubleshooting because I’ve never seen what it’s supposed to look like, lol… who would I chat with about how to proceed?
To be clear… the “no data” is probably what’s tripping up the Javascript… but still not sure what it’s supposed to be loading in some of the windows
I was just thinking that… No… even clearing the JS errors no data produces.
I was just trying to figure out which came first… no data or buggy JS… seems like data
Okay … Good to know I’m tracking the right way. I’ll dig into what specifically might be up with the data stream
Thanks  - That helps a ton for me to sort out the functionality
Hey ! Yes - I think that would be of great help. For me schedule, I’d love something toward the end of next week.

Sorry this dropped off my plate early this week but I’ll follow up by end of day today with anything that might be any more specific than what we already know, or narrow it down any… though we might not be able to.
Will do - I’ll be out today around 4:30 so I’ll make sure to bullet point it
Hey  …. with this list item, I’d love if we could communicate to Adobe something basically like “we’re not saying it’s your thing, but our list of things that could be going wrong is very small so if you can help us check this that’d be great”… but here’s the list item:
“Our app is running without errors, but it’s not getting any data from the firehose. It doesn’t appear to be a connection issue, the connection is coming in… it’s just coming in empty."
^^^ just updated that… :slightly_smiling_face:
That's right. If we had error messages, at least we would have a way to start troubleshooting… Part of the reason why we need them is because it's not giving any error messages so it's hard to tell exactly on which end the problem is occurring. As far as we can tell, it's nothing with our code.
Sounds good - at least they can narrow it down a bit. I’ll take a look at the code and get you the stream later this morning.
I think this is what she’s looking for `<https://sjo.livestream.adobe.net/api/1/stream/adobecomdemo>`
/giphy not-our-fault
That was random….
But thanks  … glad to know it wasn’t us… and that credential update will be an easy fix
I wish they had something like the GIF keyboard for iOS… where you can select a giphy… though the randomness is fun
I’m a bit swamped this afternoon but I’ll plug those credentials in Monday morning and give them a shot
So I’ve added the updated credentials and still no luck… now the console logs a new error: "'invalid authorization header’”… which means that either (1) our credentials are wrong, or (2) the way that we’re trying to authenticate is wrong….
I’ll try to rule out the second… if  has a moment and wants to try plugging it in too, that’d be great… before we go back to Jeremy and ask for their help again.
I’ll message you the new credentials







































































I gave numbers for  to take a look at - but that was just a bit ago. I'd want one of us to touch base with him if we could before sending it on




















































I’m looking for the “Amen” emoji….

















Would you say that all of your commitments endpoints should be in code review at the end of this sprint?
Yup
In that case, from a BE standpoint, we should be in code review for all of our agreed upon scope by the end of sprint 5, the only wildcard being if we get the calendar data from Jaxon/his team late in the sprint and it’s not what we expected, there might be some bleed into the next sprint.
Are any of your endpoints integrating w/ the CSE?
Yes, sorry. Just on the commitments stack. I thought we refactored those out during Sprint 3
I would think if, from the BE side, we take sprint 5 to get into code review… given our history sprint 6 there will likely be some refactoring but I’m hoping not much. So that sprint 6 we could be ready to begin integration whenever the FE was ready for it. It’s a lot more complex on their end, so I would think that the FE would drive any of the drop-dead dates for this service
Do you think “ASAP” means for MVP? I thought they had taken it out of MVP but this question leads me to believe that they want it back in?

For the moment I’m pretty much current on onboarding… I’ve got a little bit of work left regarding the latest changes, but nothing that I won’t finish today.
Of course… if code review brings forth any issues, that would change. But the majority of work is going to be reviewed by Amrita at some point
So the endpoints for onboarding and calendering are up, but they have errors. Which means once we get the error resolved, we’d be a 10 minute wait before you’d see the latest code. There’s an ongoing issue w/ the database that  is aware of which is causing an error on those dev servers. Once we get access to the database, and clear out whatever’s in there now, you should be good to start testing.
I’m speaking more for onboarding with that there. Honestly, haven’t checked in or pushed anything to the calendaring dev environment yet so I’d want to check on that first
The new biometric question doesn’t represent a ton of work for me, no


I just love that idiocracy has it’s own giphy image :slightly_smiling_face:




















It needs batteries so it’s debut will be tomorrow. We’re considering staying up all night to construct some sort of tank
I’m game… never been to Malibu before so that’d be fun.
For that Onboarding/Commitments review… did we land on 11:30 today or just hijacking the standup?
No… sorry, I meant “Calendaring/Commitments”
It’s time to up our game
That’s a recommended age
1

Lunch soon anyone?
At this point… my stomach is eating my spleen… so I’m good for anything
I can wait a few if you want… but Chinese sounds good
Closer to yes, but there’s a lot to get through?
I read Meg’s question wrong… sorry
Are Neal and Mitchell in that group as well?
Do the meeting on the call?
Totally. Maybe something quicker tho?
If we leave now… something across the street maybe? Not sure what’s there but we could walk over?
now?
cool deal
Lol… I was just thinking that…
Going to miss group lunches… we should do that once a week or something
Too true. I’m not free today/tomorrow… and since thursday/friday are halfdays… maybe wednesday we can go grab something this week?
Maybe a #lunch channel is in order
Maybe start a blog where we give them really snarky reviews…. I’m totally in.















No, I’m not sure if anything has been put into Amrita’s court. And I’m not sure if Johns intent there was that the code was being reviewed internally first and then on to her, either?
So I just noticed that some of those columns marked as “id”s are actually more like a UUID, so they need to be varchars
On the commitments table, the profile_id … I think that’s the only one
Once we get that fixed, and checked in, we’ll be ready to throw that over to Amrita for tickets 857, 863, 864 and 867
John asked me to go over a lot of the code review stuff you sent over the other week, so it should be in decent shape there
Feel free to correct me if I’m wrong here… but in case  wanted to updated the JIRA tickets… we’ve divided up by endpoint. So Bruce will take the Commitments endpoints and I’ll take the Calendar endpoints. So I think the tickets that would be switched to him would be 545, 862, 868, 960 and 961 … while the rest would remain with me
On the Commitments ERD, on the days table, there’s a “number_id” column … do you know what this field is a representation of?
Gotcha, Thanks :slightly_smiling_face:
Yes. We made about half the changes.
In addition to any of the nominal changes… All of the endpoints, with payload and responses were updated to what she’s expecting (I had to add one paramater because of an error on her part)
The only exception was the Quiz/Questionnaire related content
Yes, the DB changed
It changed (1) to use profile_id versus what I had w/ user_id and (2) I updated it to reflect your JSON schama/style of versioning versus what I had in there… which was better in that it allowed us to meet one of her requests as well
But that was it… I did not add the Question or Answer tables
Nor obviously therefore their related fields on the questionnaires table
```
        $questionnaires = $this-&gt;table('questionnaires');
        $questionnaires-&gt;addColumn('profile_id', 'string', array('limit' =&gt; 255))
                        -&gt;addColumn('version_id', 'integer')
                        -&gt;addColumn('responses', 'text')
                        -&gt;addColumn('active', 'integer', array('default' =&gt; 1))
                        -&gt;addColumn('created_at', 'datetime')
                        -&gt;addColumn('updated_at', 'datetime')
                        -&gt;save();```
There’s a quick snapshot of the table schema
We could do that… though each time that we update the database, the updated_at column would be automatically updated, so we’d have the time of deactivation already.
Not at all. I’d rename the column type in the migration file/entity. I’m thinking it’s NULL on default, right? Just trying to make sure I have a way to unset it on re-activation.
And my plan for-reactivation was just to explicitly set the active status column with each update. That way, if you wanted to reactive an inactive profile, you’d just update the profile and by doing that it sets it up active… again, this is more for just testing/database practice (if they ever did want to clean out all the deactivated users, they’d have a way to do it)
Okay, I can make that change before the standup, and be ready to hand that over to Amrita for review then
Ah - I thought I had done that… I was planning on maybe they’d name versions like their projects… “thunderbird” or something… good catch
Totally :slightly_smiling_face:
If we’re updating the doc.. we might want to use the updated_at / created_at field names
I’ll have to do some rework to get the stack matching what you have there, I already completed refactoring it based on Amrita’s review and moved on to commitments. Either way… there are a few things we would need to change some minor, some not so much…
(1) all responses have to have the success key… either true or false.. no biggie
(2) “No prior questionnaire” is I don’t think something that we’d _always_ want to return because Danny on the front end said that he has a user story that the onboarding has to support requests without profileID (which I’ve already allowed for)… so we’d just want to think through that
(3) Apigility is insanely picky about endpoints and HTTP methods. It follows strict API standards and behind the scenes does a lot of pattern matching and doesn’t give you finite endpoint control. I was able to get it match Amrita’s (even though it was non-standard) endpoints but I don’t know of any way to do get it to match yours where you’re using a POST as a PATCH with a param in the Request URL… I’m not saying Zend can’t handle it… but I don’t know that Apigility can. And even if it can, unless  knows a way real quick, I’d be at risk for not finishing my sprint on this and commitments
Allowing for the need to change the “version_id" field to just “version” … These docs contain my current endpoint structure re: Amrita’s code review: <https://github.com/jasonherndon/onboarding#bod-onboarding-microservice>
(2) That’s what I was thinking… Logic wise, the code would be doing something like 

```
if (savedUserRecordPresent)
{
   return savedUserRecordRankings
} else {

      if (questionnaireWasPosted)
      {
            return questionnaireRankings
      }

     return userRankingsNotFoundError
}```
(3) Will do, thanks… really hate (fighting) Apigility. I’ll make sure that’s done tonight before I head out.
No worries. I’m just trying to hunt down something real quick on commitments… but I’ll have that doc edited by 3:20 and ping you when it is so you can take a look at it
Sorry, I forget what you said about pagination. It was going to be handled 100% by the front end, correct?
Awesome… In prep for pagination had added a “total” key to the onboarding results to let you know how many total responses you’d be getting. Is this still useful for you in another way or shall I remove it?
Easy enough - thanks
That doc has been edited w the new endpoint info
Apigility works with it at the end easiest out of the box
I think what BOD wants is more “REST-ish” looking URLs, but with only GET and POST http methods, it’s basically like forms being submitted… kind of how it looked to me anyway
Diet-REST :slightly_smiling_face:
Same cool sounding name, half the HTTP methods :slightly_smiling_face:



If anyone else is seeing the ```activesupport requires Ruby version &gt;= 2.2.2.``` on setting up their VM’s from PuPHPet … it was a bug they fixed last week. Here’s the link to the patch <https://github.com/puphpet/puphpet/commit/1543dacab766882b969ac49d4635ccfa7c5933ae>
RE: Fetching the doctrine entities… Sorry I’m just catching up on this now, but I’m not sure we should modify our vendor files, those aren’t going to be put into version control and will be written over on composer update. Do you know if not being able to fetch those entities is going to throw an error on the BB env?
Thanks… sorry, didn’t see that. Just found the one on the Github issues page this morning
I like it… except that I’m not clear on the prompts table?
maybe talk me through it when you have a few?
Aha! It’s a pivot table for questionnaires_questions … got it… looks good
We’ll probably need to do “created_at” vs “created” / “updated_at” vs “updated” … And on the questions/answers table… do we want to add a “weight” column to support their weighting idea?
Just a note from our meetings here… some new requirements for our APIs…. 
(1) All endpoints should be prefixed w/ “/v1” … they don’t want to rely on the headers
(2) The created_at and updated_at fields should be timestamps, not datetimes…
(3) Enums are not allowed

Also, remember the FYI that we’ll be moving from Doctrine to PDO… Amrita should be going over that shortly with us, but finding time together has been difficult
We’ll be getting more info on that shortly… but we’ve been told it’s not a huge refactor. We shall see
An update on the PDO thing just to close the loop but not at all important right now… we met with a couple of BB people yesterday (Amrita and Yugant) and the PDO conversion thing the way they want it (using a fluid “interface” where you build each call) is not as easy as it was made to sound... I know you switched to PDO already, but they have a specific way they want it done… At any rate, I say all that to say that since it’s not crazy easy it’s the lowest thing on the priority right now.
In that spirit, w/ onboarding… I moved BR 1340, 1341 and 1342 into QA/Done since that work has been re-scoped. However, I’d need 3 new stories w/ the same content added… I’m in dev on those now and can be ready to start throwing some of those over the wall to Amrita for code review today
Coolio.
Those just related to the schema of calendaring… don’t know how much of that is in flux with the program info conversations w/ Jaxon and the calendaring metrics… but as I interpret those stories, there's just an agreement about what the basic Calendar schema looks like that needs to happen.
I can take a look at those… are they assigned to me? I’m not seeing them
Perfect! As long as our time is reflected somehow since I had those all the way to code review previously
That makes sense… I’ll be able to move a lot more over to Code Review today… Are we punting 967 and 968?
That works… The endpoint just hadn’t been updated with the new ERD so I just dumped everything from the model at each level.
Ok. In that case I just restored the doc to how you had that endpoint… I’ll stitch the models together to match that. I thought it was just left over from a previous iteration since the keys in the question array were different than the ERD
lol - thanks. Of course I’ll need a signed version faxed to the office, but I’ll work w/   on that :slightly_smiling_face:
Parks/Rec fan? <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzEOHNmfa_0>
I’m pretty sure most just make their own...
Vivek &amp; Amrita both agreed that they didn’t want MySQL enums. I’d assume the other is fine
Totally… string matching was what they said they preferred
absolutely


Since I'll be out of standup today (leaving soon for the afternoon), here's my update:

Onboarding: I have 1 ticket in dev, and 1 in backlog which could be moved into this sprint. The rest of my tickets are in code review. Amrita has reviewed the stack once already (<https://github.com/beachbodydigital/onboarding/pull/22>), made suggestions (like move from Doctrine to PDO). There may be some edits needed from the FE, but these will likely be minimal on my part.

Calendaring: I have 3 tickets in the backlog, which are not for this sprint I believe. The rest are in code review already. Amrita has not said anything on this stack yet.
I’ve got another client meeting at 2pm this afternoon so I may not make it to standup today (there’s a chance I might, tho)… So for standup my update is that (1) I’ve moved tickets 868 and 1304 into code review (you should’ve been copied on that email to Amrita) …. (2) I left  a slack note about some work I completed that may/may not be useful for him on the GET commitments (the one that returns the stitched calendar view) endpoint so if there is a representative story that is in need of work I can take it on since I’ve got it 99% complete anyway just by the nature of the other work I had to do. But if he’s already got that up, no worries, just thought I’d mention it (3) I’m working on ticket 960 and should have it in code review by tomorrow but could use a refresher on what the payload from the eventbus will look like again
I ended up wrapping up early so I'll be on the call
For the demo - I’ve got Calendaring stuff as well, but it’s really small so if you want to just add it into my time w/ onboarding I can do that. It’s the marking of an activity as complete. But it’s so super small and simple. I can demo it, but it’ll be really puny without the full commitments/calendar view that Bruce and I are working on now.
Yeah - I can hand that off to Bruce to demo. I just did the marking of the activity as complete - the day “knowing” it would be complete or not would be the full stitched view, I believe. Which is what he and I are working on now
That is to say, I don’t think that the ERD allows for a day knowing if it’s complete or not, it’s calculated by the commitment endpoint when that stitched calendar is returned

I’m not entirely sure as I’ve never been able to get into the database but it needs to be cleared as there seems to be an error with the migrations log
If we clear it out and then redeploy, all should be well.
Requested permission
Regarding the storing of the calendars… do they ever update? I always thought of them as fairly permanent, but I’m just wondering if we should call out that the calendar data representation goes from Excel -&gt; JSON files -&gt; DB where it’s served. So if we wanted to update a calendar, we’d have to follow that flow again? Just not sure how to best phrase that
Coolio. That was all I could think of, doc looks like it covered everything else :slightly_smiling_face:
and I chatted about it yesterday afternoon and he walked me thru a bit of the code. I’m working on it now and hope to have it by today EOD if at all possible
Actually - I could use your development.config.php and /autoload/local.php files if you have them handy
Thanks :slightly_smiling_face:
The code searches for any calendars with that brandCode in the program_calendars table and returns an object with those calendars in it. It also filters based on kitType if that param is passed, which is optional, though the brandCode isn't
Totally
I’ve committed my branch with the consolidation of Commitment code for the Calendar endpoints and issued a pull request (I’ll follow up with an email in a bit)  I’ll be adding a commit to your branch with the fix for pulling a calendar name (already done) and getting all days in a calendar (even if they don’t contain activities - though it is not really a use case) (which I am working on now)… the changes to the actual commitments graph we identified yesterday can be sorted out later, I suppose
Gotcha - I thought you had said that  advised us to include them. In that case I think I’m done for the moment.
Sorry, not sure why we’d build it for the left join, then go back to inner join?
I’ll let you tackle that. My inclination would be that if we’re not going to use it I wouldn’t worry too much about it. On the Graph service, lines 49 and 59 check if null before appending data to the array so I don’t think anything would break. Possibly return null?
Unless I get held up, I am planning to be out of the office today by the time that standup occurs. I’ll send an email with my project updates

was just asking me about that… I felt like we were leaning toward the BE doing the work of fetching entitlements and returning something like ```{ “entitledPrograms”: anObjectOfEntitledProgramMatches, “forPurchasePrograms”: anObjectofForPurposeProgramMatches }```
^^ is that what you were thinking?
Each object would be sorted… when you say “the highest ranked of them all” are you thinking of that top “hero” recommendation… in that case I understand that to be the first entitled match, no?
If that first object is meant to be either entitled or for purchase, I can send that to you as a third object like… `topProgramMatch`. If that saves you work on the FE it’d be easy for me to pop off on the BE
Yeah, I think that the entitled or unlocked program endpoints should return a limited amount…. perhaps not by default but at least with that option
Okay, I can provide that if we need it :slightly_smiling_face:
There’s like 58 programs… if you only need 10 or 11, at most, I see no reason to return them all to you
I think that's a good idea. (Especially if they ever wanted to do any other view with something like "Let me see all my recommended programs" or perhaps, with a little tweaking, something that allowed them to see all the potentially recommended programs for a given subset of users...)
Good to know. In that case, I’ll send 3 objects back to you (in addition to the “success”: “true”…. something like, “EntitledRecommendations”, “ForPurchaseRecommendations” and “TopRecommendation”)
I was just looking at that… that `user/responses/&lt;profileID&gt;` returns the entire questionnaire w/ no answers in it. If you need an entirely different object, We’d probably want a different endpoint. But if I can just append a key/value to that object with something like “filledOut”: “false” … that’d be a way to use the same endpoint and save the FE a call
I agree on the benefits of another endpoint for the sake of the weight of the call… just didn’t want to mess up the UI flow if you needed it to happen in one call… I could easily do both so that you had options? Add a flag to the existing object to save you the logic of checking and comparing with an unanswered questionnaire…. and add an endpoint to serve as a simple true/false in case that is needed as well?
So the question to the API would be, “For X specific version of the questionnaire, has the logged in user completed all of the questions?"
?
While we’re building it… let’s maybe just leave it open … something like an endpoint `user/responses/status/&lt;profileId&gt;?version=&lt;versionId&gt;` and I return a “hasCompleted” true/false, “hasStarted” true/false, “lastQuestion”, with an ID, and the timestamp from their responses. I mean… I’m going to have access to all of that on the backend in order to even answer one of those questions
How the FE knows what version to use (   can correct me if I’m wrong ) is still somewhat up in the air. Eventually, there may be a CMS tie-in, but for now I believe it’s sort of a combination of hardcoding and trust
I can mirror those in the user/responses obj too if you’d like access to it there as well
“Hardcoding and Trust”?
A band/startup maybe…. or a tell-all book of our experience w/ BeachBody… “Hardcoding and Trust: A True-Story of Hard Bodies, Best Practices and the Project That Put Them All To the Test"
I’m not 100% sure… to be honest it’s a bit OBJECTive
Fine… I’ll give it a REST.
From what I understand, Sam and Amrita have very different expectations for how they like to use Github. Sam seems to require small changes be on new pull requests while Amrita seems to largely ignore Jira ticket, and prefers to look at a whole feature when it's finished
Just thinking that perhaps using the same approach on both the front and the back end, might not do well with what they are expecting
5 min should be good for me. I’ll be demoing (1) GET all questionnaires, (2) POST to create new questionnaire, (3) POST to update existing questionnaire. All other tickets have either already been demo’d in previous demos or are not really demo-able (for example consolidation of PRs on Github)
Yes… I’m a little nervous about them as they’ve not been code reviewed or talked about a whole lot w/ the technical people there at BB, but they’ve definitely been asked for. I’m thinking about maybe prefacing it with something that allows me to say that these could change depending on future CMS integration? Think that’s a good idea to call it out beforehand or just present it?
Just a reminder that I'll be out of the office on Monday, but I will have the video for the demo ready for Tuesday.
I don't have an invite to tomorrow's demo for some reason - could you forward it to me :-)
that was it - I'm done ;-) back to enjoying my girls!
Yes, I don’t believe that’s ever happened.
Did you catch the countries listed in the registration? It’s supporting outside US users…. should we bring up at some point metric versus imperial for the biometrics (lbs vs kg)?
Not in this mtg, of course… just throwing it out there
I had thought about hooking into the camera that was on the device they were accessing from, and trying to measure of the number of tea cups or Maple leafs in the room, but yeah… A flag from the login ID sounds like a much better solution. :-) I agree that we shouldn't make it needlessly complex, or take on more than we can, but if at launch a user from the UK has to convert to pounds, I imagine that's going to be a big red flag. I think if it's something that they want us to support intuitively, then they'll have to find a way to get us the data from the logged in users profile. Though I don't know if they will always have the country information available during on boarding.
I can. Anything I should bring up if asked?
Will do. Let me know if anything else comes to mind.
Vivek wasn’t on the sync-up. Just Amrita. I voiced #1 and re:#2 said something like… “And we’re still having that ongoing conversation about the best way to do code reviews, so we’ll want to figure that out so that we’re not continuing to be blocked.”… the response was… “Okay… on to Jeff Paul?"
… Sublime’s “Beta” is kind of a running joke… It’s been in beta for years.
But you can “buy” a license to the beta v3…. so I think “beta” is kind of misleading. (though most don’t buy the license)
Real programmers use butterflies… <https://xkcd.com/378/>
Does this also mean we are good to merge all outstanding PRs for onboarding into master as well? I know  is awaiting a dev box he can hit
/giphy plausible deniability
Sorry - I've not dealt with that
is that setup on local?
what’s the repo you’re using?
This is likely a question for  or
Or perhaps ?
Is that form posting to /api/v1/auth/login?
Does <mailto:johana@beachbody.com|johana@beachbody.com> sound right?
I have him on slack and can run that down for us… I’m asking for login credentials for the FE site?
Okay  - I just pinged him. I’ll add it to the channel if he gets back with us.
Thanks

- So we’ll not be storing biometric questions at all and always pushing/pulling that data to/from the biometric API? Sounds good to me.
Totally - I’d store it in both out of preference for not deleting data. Thought he API is the source of truth.
It does… the term-feature would be a flag for the front end, no?
RE: term-feature… there’s also, on that same table, a column called “question type” which is a string that, for those questions, marks them as “input”… so would the “term-feature”, if I’m reading this right, be “biometrics” or more specifically the individual question, “weight”, “height”, “gender”, etc. I’m thinking since it’s on a question level, using the term-feature field as a description of the question itself seems most handy.
Gotcha… I was thinking more of a flag on the front end for styling purposes, but if we’re also pushing this up to the API, we’ll want that.
My Update for standup today… still working on ticket 1571. I had an error I can share during the call as it might be useful for others to know… but it has been causing me to slow down a little bit (and consider a career in plant husbandry, where unit testing isn’t a thing)… I’ve removed half that blocker and look forward to continuing on to remove the rest of it this afternoon.
So now that we’re owning our own deployments a bit more… can we reach out to devops again to get credentials for  and I to the dev databases? I know we’ve tried to get that setup before but I don’t recall that we had all the pieces we needed to connect to mysql
Totally - I’ve got that in my inbox for “loose ends”… I’m trying to catch up at the moment but I’ll circle back to that today :slightly_smiling_face:

For tickets not started, I’ve just added a comment which says that work has not begun. For those in code review, I’ve noted those as well. Other than going back and including the PR link from Github - I can’t think of any more detail to add to those. Does that work for you guys?
There’s a client stopping by the office… I might miss standup - if I do, my update was the same as yesterday. (1) Question out to Will Kray regarding an error on the onboarding dev4 box (2) Working on vvLog updates (3) Working on ticket 1946… I had an error w/ a Github merge conflict that I’ve resolved now, so this will be submitted to PR tomorrow
The email I just got was for Friday
I’m jumping on :slightly_smiling_face:
You’re talking about the FE, correct?
Yeah - that’s how it will work. The selection of which onboarding survey to use could be as simple as a selector in the CMS or it could be something a bit more complicated w/ A/B tests running. But yeah, the those GET ALL endpoints are for the CMS integration, so that would likely fall on XWP at some point
Yes, the way in which the questionnaire that a user is provided (once we have multiple versions of the questionnaire running) is a bit of a mystery. Not sure if that will be a separate call or not. For the moment though, since they’re only launching with the one, we’ll want to ignore questionnaire selection… so then the question becomes, what’s the most non-offensive way to hard-code this
I mean… BB feels better about “hard coding” that comes from a database… so if you wanted to do a call to “GET ALL QUESTIONNAIRES” and just use first result from that response… it would be more future proofed than it is now… (I’d need to update the code slightly to reverse sort just so that you got the right one)… it’s more complex for the FE, but if you think they’d feel better about it the endpoint is up
To quote  …. “They’re aren’t enough satellites in this solution”… Okay, feel free to do whichever you think they’d like best, but if there is a need to use the “Get All” like a “Get the Right One” placeholder endpoint, let me know and I can add a way to adjust the sort on it through a URL param so you can do that.
So... My kids just got sick. So I'm going to have to run and hang with them today.... If anyone needs me I'll be available on Slack/Email if anyone needs me but wouldn't count on me to make any meetings, sorry.
I have a Jenkins login - but I’m not sure how I’d upload images through it?
Can I use the CMS to upload it - or am I uploading to a bucket?
Sorry - still kind of in the weeds with kid stuff… my update is that the blocker I and Danny had yesterday was resolved, just working on integrating it with all the other services… so now I’m down to one final error (one of my endpoints is timing out)… after that I should be clear to get through my tickets - there’s not a lot of work there.
Oh! And… though Josh approved the work for vvLog - Will Kray and Steve Lee are apparently brainstorming how to implement it… I’ve got plenty to do for the next couple days, and they’re being responsive… so it’s not really a blocker, just more a heads up.
Sort of depends on how far from what we planned originally their solution is, so I’ll keep you in the loop
Just a reminder to turn off notifications on your computer when demoing…. in case I want to send you weird giphy’s
I have access into their dev box now for onboarding… so I’m attempting to figure out that gateway timeout error which is not letting you hit the real endpoint… I’ll let you know when it’s resolved but hopefully it’s today
Since the FE is making a call to a full URL anyway, I’m understanding the combining of the environments to be mainly cosmetic, no?
Gotcha. But that’s definitely something we can bring up with Steve Lee
Yeah - it was a bit surprising for me b/c Steve set all that up
I think he didn’t know to combine them, and we didn’t know we needed to ask them to either
I know that at least Will Kray (who is on Steve’s team) was in the room sitting on the floor listening in… b/c we were chatting at the time
brought up possible CORS issues?
I’m redeploying… I’m close to fixing the errors on that box so it might give you that sort of thing every now and then, I apologize
Hopefully should be done this morning, w/in a couple hours without only a few more interruptions. They last about 5 min
I can give you a heads up before I do it :slightly_smiling_face:

What a “standard” user has is a good question… we should ask  to raise this issue. I know that the FE has had similar questions
I slacked it in this channel at the time of the meeting. It worked for Andres at the time I believe but I’ve not tested it

A 3 point weight for that story should be good.  says that most of that functionality is already built so adding it to a page (or two) should represent more than a day (for either a link to onboarding or a modal) … though if they want it all over the place that might be more work, but I think they only want it on the account profile page
Would you feel better about 5 or would 3 plus the other stories cover it you think?
Nope… not at all. I’ve heard conflicting things. I’ve heard (1) Every member has access to some free content on on signup, others can be purchased AND (2) Vivek and others have asked “what do we do if a member is entitled to nothing” … which seems to violate the first thing. So I’m not sure which is correct
We’ve gamed out what to do if there are less entitlements… I think  was going to get w/  to see if it was gamed out
We already did that the Biometric API implementation… I can run down a JIRA ticket number if you need it, but it’s done
1
Or 2… probably more like 2 w/ testing and a refactor later on I forgot about
So I’m not 100% sure I understand when you say `I’m wondering if we should make the effort to get it from the DB` …. but recall that the DB here for biometrics is a BB thing… we don’t own any of that and our data isn’t supposed to be used (even though we save it)… does that complicate things?
so much other stuff is hard coded at this point… it’s like “what’s one more?"
I was in on that meeting - could you post the link to that doc again?
I forget if that was even covered… we focused on the page_name and the event level stuff more
Did we ever get a sample codebase they’ve used this method on?
Yeah - I’m not sure. On their slack channel… Hasib Saliefendic would be the guy to ask. He was very cool and flexible to work with
… Danny is out of the office today
Did you try really meaning it when pressing `Enter`?
There’s your problem, right there.
So… given Jona’s communication, before we have  raise this with Danny S., we should try his suggestion to create an account on <http://clubbeachbody.com|clubbeachbody.com>
So what you’re saying is their website is top notch?
Any FE devs at the office?

We’ve got the standup at 3… but Vivek has moved his sync-up to 2:45… should we do 3:15?
If I was any more ready for the demo at 10:30… I’d be ready for the demo at 10:30
The BE of the FE?
There’s a BE issue I’ve started working w/ Steve Lee on…. if it’s a FE thing, is someone chasing down who we contact to fix it?
They might be related? My issue is a result of the build process… a 502 gateway could be the same. I’ll raise the issue with Steve carefully today :slightly_smiling_face:
Does it say they’re running nginx?
<!here|@here> BTW - apologies for anyone who gets copies amounts of Github notifications about my pull requests… their dev environment behaves differently and doesn’t really allow me test sometimes other than to push and redeploy
/giphy beautiful-day
Life does that . Life does that.
I think he was trying to say that BB's backend is awe-inspiring and majestic
So it sounds like Vivek is asking us to use a fake profile ID for LO users through onboarding… (I’ve got a question out to him as to if these needs to be a truly fake number or tied to a user’s session)… It makes things easier for  in terms of only having one GET request… but for  there’s a couple questions:
(1) Is he generating this, or should it come higher up in the request chain from some of BOD’s code in the auth or page setup?
(2) If he’s generating this, who would we check with on their FE team to know if they have any preference for how that gets generated?
^^  Feel free to correct me if I’m not relating those questions well
We do… but Vivek is raising a fuss about the LO users request being a POST versus a GET and raised the issue to Matt and Bruce on their end in a sort of “they didn’t say they were doing this” … because he’s right, the LO user endpoint wasn’t in the tech docs
Just forwarded you my responses to him in case you didn’t see that… sorry, didn’t check who was on it
Should be easy enough on the server end… since we don’t need to know the difference between a real and a fake profile id
A new row in the table, yes
It’s a text field… you could literally test with a limerick and as long as it was under 255 characters it’d be good
not performant… but good :slightly_smiling_face:
Don’t forget the version - <http://onboarding-dev4.dev.api.beachbodyondemand.com/v1/user/responses/there-once-was-a-girl-from-nantucket?version=thunderbird>
I plan to clarify that on a call I have w/ Vivek at 2:45… the only thing I can think of is if they want to migrate a user who signs up in the same session’s answers
I can bring it up… but if it’s FE related I wouldn’t expect to get an answer from Vivek. He tends to leave that all to Sam
Although I just remembered that Sam is supposed to be on these calls… so if he’s there we can raise the issue with him
As I thought… Vivek differed to Sam… I’ll start an email thread on that.
It’s Sam Alrares, correct?
yes … totally
This is more a FE thing… though it came thru me/vivek… do you mind if I kick off that email thread w/ Sam or do you want to?
Context… sorry :slightly_smiling_face: I was referencing the issue about how the FE creates IDs
Though we did say that there was a need for this to be able to potentially translate to a user if they sign up afterward… does that answer any of the questions
Yeah…. so, the idea I think is that they need to be going through onboarding with some kind of identifier that, if they signed up later, they could send to the BE of onboarding and get their previous results
obv… things like “how later” and… “on what device” … play into this… but I think the intent is if they sign up immediately
Honestly… I’m a bit out of my ballpark here in terms of what’s MVP for FE and not. I was just translating the need from Vivek’s perspective to (1) reduce the number of endpoints our service has and (2) provide something that could, if the user clicks on a recommendation and signed up, identify that user.
I don’t even know if Vivek is aware of all the FE complexity of it
Is there any ticket in JIRA on the FE that represents this?
for some reason I thought I heard of a ticket for the FE that represented the passing of an ID from onboarding to signup… but I could be 100% wrong there
Totally understand about scope creep… I know there’s been others like this. I think this is more just a misalignment from what their BE people were expecting and what their FE people were expecting
True… is there an easy way in React or their Auth object to grab Session IDs? I did something like this once w/ a hashed session ID … but it wasn’t this complex so I’m not sure that would work here
Too much for ask for a little React + Facial Recognition on the FE?
Safer too!
So unless you just solved the internet… Does maybe  setting up a call w/ Sam and his team and you guys to kick this off and get some quicker feedback sound like a good idea?
we’ve estimated it at 1pt… told them you’d have it by tomorrow
/giphy kthxbai

devOps broke something yesterday… I’m trying to log in to Dev4 and fix it now…. everyone hold your breath
How is he still typing!!!!
/giphy liar
Okay… I fixed it
I mean… I “fixed” it… if I deploy again… it’ll break until DevOps gets their stuff together a bit more…. but it’s working on Dev4 for you to continue whatever voodoo you do on the FE
That’s us w/ the matching algorithm :slightly_smiling_face:
And no… we’ve not perfected it… mainly because we designed it to work with about 7 different inputs and then they were like… “yeah, you’re only getting 2…” which means that the standard deviation is minimal
/giphy standard-deviation-chart
nope
they’ve signed a liability waiver :slightly_smiling_face:
configuration?
So the problem is that it looks like a lot of the data you’re entering or adjusting is being counted… it’s not
afk for a few minutes :slightly_smiling_face:
The only data points that are being factored are the goals, workout intensity, type and duration. And those four inputs are only sourced by three data points on their end for each program. And… of those three data points… among all of their programs, there is very little difference. There’s not a huge distribution in workout times or intensity for instance…. the biggest factor, in terms of the algorithm, is the workout types… but even then the variance isn’t huge.
The best way to explain it is here: <http://www.cc.com/video-clips/pymif1/comedy-central-presents-bottled-water> …. at minute 1:50.
Yeah… most of the content is like that… 30 minute workout, beginner intensity, cardio… there’s definitely some variation, but not as much as the onboarding questions might lead one to believe
I mean…. if you wanna get really postmodernist about it… I guess so
What can I say? I like big jokes and I cannot lie
I covered for you… told everyone you were having trouble getting your eyebrows waxed. They seemed chill.
<!here|@here> Pushing a new version of the onboarding API in a moment so if you’re using Dev4 at the moment… it’s about to break.
I assure you all… there’s no way I could be THAT Jason… running around in a hockey mask, killing people and stuff…
I mean, do you know how ugly I’d look with a hockey mask on? Ugh.
Onboarding on DEV4 back up
Not an easy clear API method as in a route… but you can always POST to the POST User Responses endpoint to clear out all of their answers. Just send it the question with no answers.
```{
  "questionnaireId": "thunderbird",
  "responses": [
    {
      "prompt_id": 1,
      "question_id": 1,
      "answers": []
    },
    {
      "prompt_id": 2,
      "question_id": 2,
      "answers": []
    },
    {
      "prompt_id": 3,
      "question_id": 3,
      "answers": []
    },
    {
      "prompt_id": 4,
      "question_id": 4,
      "answers": []
    },
    {
      "prompt_id": 5,
      "question_id": 5,
      "answers": []
    },
    {
      "prompt_id": 5,
      "question_id": 6,
      "answers": []
    },
    {
      "prompt_id": 5,
      "question_id": 7,
      "answers": []
    },
    {
      "prompt_id": 5,
      "question_id": 8,
      "answers": []
    }
  ]
}```
Tried it on Dev4 and doing that for a user clears out all their responses and causes the 409 error code to present when attempting to get recommendations
I’m good to hit that
I’m good either way.. this will be a small thing
Should I wait for Vivek’s approval on this or is he in the loop to expect it?
Yes… but given the date in what format… seconds since the epoch? … lol - sounds good, I’ll have it workout out tomorrow morning
Ah… such a good movie
Not sure where we landed on this.. but for the POST that handles moving the saved responses from a LO user to a newly signed up LI user…. who’s handling that?
Just wondering what the ```{
  "idType": XXX
}``` in the POST body was supposed to represent again
…. did you add the “idType” to the posting of a user’s responses?
Coolio -just getting it integrated into the BE now
Okay… I’m having to update my DB schema to take that in when you post it… do we know if that switch from LO to LI endpoint has been assigned to one of you guys yet?
Yeah - that’s tracking… we added an endpoint ```user/responses/&lt;old_owner&gt;/owner/&lt;new_owner&gt;``` …  would recall best where the call is made tho
Okay… I’m just coding against that being an string
Just saw the docs on that… sorry, was looking in the wrong doc for the wrong thing :slightly_smiling_face:
Do we know where the call happens?
Gotcha… so it’s owned by BB?
Any reason why we’re posting the ```{
  "idType": XXX
}``` on the call to change owners of responses? … won’t it always go from “known” to “anonymous”? future proofing so they can control what those keys are?
analytics log?
I need more thumbs….
Ah yes…..
Maybe...
So actually… I think I’m confusing those issues? … Striking my last message from the record
Yeah.. they have to be https
Don’t know if any auth headers have to be sent.. but I don’t think go
There’s no BE need for the strings to be of any specific type, except that they be under ~255 characters. The biggest thing we’d have to worry about is if there was any collision. Sometimes “randoms” are not truly “random”… Are we using the npm package for this still?
I would say that the package does a great job of protecting us against collisions. Not that something hand-rolled couldn’t do that, just not as well I don’t think.
with `node-uuid` is their V4 uuid the same as the “type 4 guid” ?
Yeah, I’m not sure either. For protecting against collisions, I like v1. But to ’s point of pushing back with the design doc I was thinking it might make it easy to say.. “look, you asked for X type of ID, this package/bit of code gives us X type of ID…” ...
If you can leave giphys in their comments, I’d recommend:
/giphy drops mic
I was thinking everything would be better if we worried about how it interacted with databased. Ex: <https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/5/5f/exploits_of_a_mom.png>
Do they have automatic builds that overwrite the configuration files. Their jenkins deploy process does this certain local.php files on the BE…. and when they did we experienced issues with the URLs not being set right. Don’t know 100% that they do that for the FE…. but it sounds like you’re having the same issues
Specifically… the `/src/constants/api.js` file?
So for what it’s worth… looks like there’s an error on QA where when the user goes through onboarding, they get redirecting to the start again instead of seeing the results page
This is likely a result of either (1) the results not saving or (2) the results page not accurately routing...
I told them I’d post it here…. that it was the weekend so of course we have limited availability (read: no obligation to be available… especially since they waiting until the last minute to test this) … if someone feels the need to check it out a bit, cool… if not, that’s cool too.
/giphy hands washed
Thanks  :slightly_smiling_face:
The error you posted above (the JSON error) is a result of the onboarding API BE failing… there’s a call to the Entitlements API that was working Friday, but is not working today. I’m not sure what that is… but I’ll have to work through it with BB as their API is throwing ```Fatal error: Call to undefined method stdClass::getEntitlement() in /var/www/html/profile/module/Entitlements/src/Entitlements/V1/Rest/Entitlements/EntitlementsResource.php on line 124``` … there’s a gap in logic where the onboarding service is saying “this is a valid user” and their service is erroring out… so the response comes back “we have no results”… which isn’t technically true.
I’ll get with them to see what’s up with their entitlement API
Yeah… the Audience API (our endpoints) isn't doing anything with a date/time field at all.
And in full disclosure… I’m not 100% following the convo happening. I mean, I can read the words… but not always understanding of it :slightly_smiling_face:
Isn’t.. sorry
Yeah … it seemed like Gerard is just wanting to offload the date conversion, if any, to another service… seemed like Will was wanting him to do it
On the vvLog redeploy… Am I good to redeploy to dev4 or are they expecting it in another environment as well?
^^
I just stepped out for about 40 minutes but if you need it sooner than that I'll have my phone handy to send you the text conf #
So it looks like there’s a slight bug with the onboarding FE… the request to save a user’s responses (at least the logged out users) do not have the `?version=thunderbird` attached at the end of it, so no recommendations for that version are being pulled. I know everyone is traveling, just throwing it out there for when you do settle in.
Sure
I mean… if I’m available. I don’t know… there are a lot of important things I have to do today. Important meetings and such. Business-like meetings. Yes-sir-e …. definitely, 100% real business taking place over here

Okay :slightly_smiling_face:
Okay - I can jump in a fix those later tonight if that helps... but if it's no longer a burning issue, I'll take a look at it first thing in the morning.
Working on it now - should have it pushed in about 25 minutes :slightly_smiling_face:
Fixes made, deploying to Dev4 at the moment, I’d let Eddie know if you need it in QA.
Besides fixing the division by zero issue, I should note the following changes I made to make the error responses a bit more verbose: ``` - You will now get an error if one of responses in the POST to `/user/responses` does not include a prompt_id
- You will now get an error if the biometrics are incorrectly passed (not 100% sure this was the issue with that one `birthday` error, but I couldn’t get it reproduced, so let me know if it comes back)
- I put each call to an outside API in it’s own try/catch block with a custom response that tells you which API call failed.```
Hopefully the above should fix everything, or at least let us know what exactly is failing so we can tell immediately if it’s a devOps thing, a FE thing or a BE thing :slightly_smiling_face:

<http://images.memes.com/meme/857905>
Looks like it’s working… sort of?
It’s letting me go through… my answers are saved… and the calls aren’t failing… there’s just no data
Well, for one… this doesn’t have my latest commits
The answers appear to be posting as those calls are working find… as is the GET user/responses/ call
(apart from a couple warnings that should be cleared up with my latest commit)
I don’t see how…
It’s showing an error that it shouldn’t be able to
Don’t see how I’m getting a notice for an unset array value given <https://github.com/beachbodydigital/onboarding/commit/8e320a7604ded6dcab72c394a279ce44059f007d#diff-e7320704205d0348ca01902046f714d1R241>
Here’s what I’m seeing…. feel free to chime in anyone if you have any ammendments. Issues w/ Onboarding: ```
- Latest commits from /onboarding not pulled in. 
- Getting each local.php file built with the right environment variables 
- Figure out why the programs are all returning 0% match
- Figure out why there’s no image/trainer name program info
- What is onboarding? How do you on the board? Am I onboard? ```
So the answer to #4 above (no pictures/trainer info on the results page) is that the content doesn’t exist in QA5 … see `<https://onboarding-qa5-origin.api.beachbodyondemand.com/v1/user/recommendations>`
Totally… In looking through the “why do they always return 0%… I’m seeing some different values than I expect… might need to redeploy in a few minutes, checking what’s there now.
Okay… we’re getting better
Results are no longer 0%… though they are all the same… at least for me… combing through the algorithm now to see if I can fine tune it to be a bit more sensitive …. 90% of their data looks all the same and we sort of weren’t expecting that
Okay…. there were some changes to the algorithm to adjust for a change in the format of their content that we hadn’t expected. Everything should run the same, but with greater result variation
/giphy redeploy!
Yes - about 5 minutes ago
Yes
There was something that we were expecting to get in a string… it is now coming in as an array. I’m not sure when the change happened
I didn’t notice until QA… all of my local tests showed a high degree of variation in program matches… the code that’s up there now doesn’t… but when you redeploy that will be fixed
It was the program workoutTypes value :slightly_smiling_face:
So… 60% of that will be fixed with the next redeploy… the remaining 40% with greater content curation
For instance…. in terms of intensity… only 3 or 4 programs are rated a “2”… and 1 program rated a “3” …. the other programs are all rated “1” …. when their data set isn’t varied, the results aren’t going to be either… but again, a good portion of that will be covered in this fix
For a greater look at the data that this page is using, and just how consistent it is from program to program, you can hit `<https://onboarding-qa5-origin.api.beachbodyondemand.com/v1/user/recommendations>` in your browser/postman
So… looks like we’ve redeployed… Now I’m getting the following ```
- All programs weighted the same
- When moving from card to card… I get this error - Malformed request - prompt_id must be supplied for each response```
Are we sure that the prompt_id is being passed in the response object like this:
```  
"responses": [
    {
      "prompt_id": 1,
      "question_id": 1,
      "answers": []
    },
```
I think I’ve got it here...
From the networking tab… a response object looks like this:
```{
prompt_id: "1”,
 question_id: "1", 
answers: [
{id: "1", data: null}, 
{id: "3", data: null}]
}```
are those `id`s being cast as integers or strings?
Unless the network tab is linting it…
If that’s how they’re coming in, that might be the error...
Although here’s the code that’s throwing that error:
```
if (!isset($questionresponse['prompt_id']))
{
   return new ApiProblem(422, 'Malformed request - prompt_id must be supplied for each response.');            
}
```
So I don’t know how that error is getting throw?
Yup! That’s the error…
Here’s the full response ```{
	"questionnaireId": "thunderbird",

	"responses": [{

Notice that last data set doesn’t have a prompt_id … I’m not sure where it’s coming from but that’s causing the error
Yes, I can ignore any response that doesn’t have it (instead of throwing an error) … though that doesn’t really solve it on the FE side.
No worries :slightly_smiling_face: I think it’s coming from this card `How fit do you consider yourself right now?`
The fact that it’s out of order is what’s weird for me… I’d think question 4 would go before question 5
I think it’s on my end… I think you’re passing back the object you got from the /GET/user/responses … and I’m giving it back to you that way
Let me check it out
As I’m looking at it, looks like it’s both of us
we need those darn wonder twin rings
I send you that bad response… but only if that question isn’t sent… so (1) I should make sure that the response is built right… but (2) maybe you or nathan can look into why that card isn’t sending a response ?
Maybe… so if a user skips it, there’s no default value sent, correct?
So I found my fix on my end… I just needed to add the prompt_id to unanswered questions… though on the FE we should look at what exactly gets submitted for unanswered questions
Either way… this maybe would fix it
I’m redeploying the onboarding stack to Dev4 and Dev6 as we speak… type… .whatever… should be ready in about 5 minutes
If we can get a redeploy to QA this would solve that error which (unless it happens to somehow fix the other) would mean we should still look at why the results are coming back with the same % match on QA but not on other environments
I’ll be AFK for about 30 minutes travel time… I’ll have slack so let me know if you need anything… and I’ll be sure to check in here when I get home
I'm back... let me know if you need anything. I'll watch the conversations until the die
Sounds good :-) hope everyone there enjoys the night. Moon shadow?
Included in this latest push is another small change to the algorithm… I spent a couple hours last night just dumping all the results… over and over again… the slight improvement pushed this morning will somewhat help, but at this point if they push back any more with “why are all the program matches the same”, we need to push back with “because all of your data is the same” (if this hasn’t been brought up already) … Given the lack of variation in the data, the fact that certain values on the FE are mapped to the same values on the BE because their questions don’t match exactly their program values… it creates very little room for deviation.
I’ve got that info handy… just wrapping up something here… I’ll have it over to you before lunch

So the QA environment does need to be formally redeployed. Eddie on their team is creating a ticket to do so now.
So… looks like Sam has merged the PR from this morning
It’s now on DevOps to redeploy … and then everyone should see the latest changes
/giphy standup
like the top half or the bottom half?
I’ll take a look at that results page too
does it only work for logged in users?
Or not.. nm
I just got a “division by zero” error… that and your unexpected results are likely a result of their input data
that’s because there’s only 3 courses / about 54 that match muscle/strength training
I’m going to ask for a redeploy… shouldn’t effect anything, but will maybe make it a bit more sensitive. We’ll see…
If you want to try it out (now or even then) the only fields that really matter are workout type and goals… most other things don’t matter at all, or very little
Good! I was super worried about that!
Not very clever, but effective
Yes, that is a real result. But I would think it is to be expected given that If I have a set of 4 criteria… and out of the 50something programs a large number of them contain the same program data… I would think we’d get the same results.
The data on QA5 is in a much better place that it was last week… but there’s still a lot of overlap
Yes… the data has been updated and the algorithm has been updated to account for any differences in how we were expecting data to come in versus how it’s coming in now
I can copy down the json output from the QA5 server and run through the algorithm again though - just to be safe
From QA5? They’re all 0-90 minutes
Looking through the data now
All the intensities are there… 39/51 rated a 1… 2s and 3s taking the rest
Yes - it’s alphabetical by programTitle
So  … This morning I made a change in the DurationScoring code… I changed ```return ($minMinutes + $midMinutes + $maxMinutes) / 3;
``` to ```return ($minMinutes + $midMinutes + $maxMinutes) / 4;
``` which I think may have been a mistake. My thinking was that the denominator represented the number of *times* I was scoring the duration (4) … but I think it should be the number of *ways* I’m scoring the duration (3) … though honestly this effects the outcome very little. And that’s the point that I guess I’ve arrived at… Could there be some point of my math that’s incorrect? Absolutely! (I’d love a code review)…. But if I’m wrong in my math I would think that the outcome would be that a program which should be scored at, let’s say, 90% may return 5% or 120% or 70%…. but I don’t see any way that I could be wrong with the math in such a way that ranks programs the same? Going crazy here man, lol….. Is it the normalizing of each program measurement point?
/giphy going crazy
Things I know ```Each of the 4 ways a program can be measured is:
- Is capturing the right representative data from the programs
- Returning unique values for each program
- Being normalized before being passed to the code that ranks a program overall
- It’s not the rounding off…. changing it from 4 decimal places to 12 gives me no difference, so it’s not that the difference is just hidden further down the line, so to speak```
I figured it out
I’m seriously about to looooooooose my mind
Yup…. so… previously… out of 9 results there were 2 unique values
Which would mean roughly 70% of their inputs data points where the same… this used to be true… it no longer is… so obviously…. #somethings up
Now… out of the 9 results on the two randomly entitled users I’m using…. there are 5 unique values
And I’ve only converted about half my code base
It was the difference between things like ```Slim &amp; Tone``` to the inputs we’re actually getting which are ```Slim tone```
We have got to find a way to stress that these inputs in their content API correlate to actual things in the algorithm… Between environments, and versions, and changes like this (that happened I don’t know when) it’s getting really hard to keep the algorithm clean
So..  I would tell BeachBody that I figured it out… there was a change in the content I either wasn’t expecting or missed… that I’ll fix it… but then we should have  or someone on their side review it to double check in case I’m still wrong …. that would be my vote :slightly_smiling_face:
As well… we need some input on their part about some new WorkoutType values that we’re seeing… I’ll form it in an email but they’ve recently added content that we need to determine how to map to the onboarding questions
Thanks… just added the other point about the new content to the thread as well
lol - I’m drafting the email now but was just going to ask you the same thing?
It’s a product thing, I think… so Love/Josh
Could you post that link? I can't find it, sorry
Did we move it to confluence?
So yeah… we’ll need to update this when they respond (and now I see an error I made on the email). But the document lists only three of the possible goals mapping to the workout types.
Perhaps this was intentional, but given that those three were the only that we were seeing in the content from their API at the time, I thought that the new data might change those mappings
If that was intentional, I’ll just reply to all with a … nevermind, sorry!… otherwise I’ll let the email stand (for the most part)
I’m going to apologize  … feel like I’m being overly verbose and unnecessarily longwinded… I’ll try to make it plainer….
“Is there any value to asking them to look over the mapping again and see if any more of those workout types can be mapped to goals, or should I recall that email?"
Okay - thanks for the input, that’s good to know :slightly_smiling_face:

Oh holy giphy
He is enjoying that WAY too much
Not like that
Could you look at this ticket… is this a FE thing? <http://jira.beachbodyondemand.local/browse/BR-2786>
Sorry!
^^
Sweeet!
In a few minutes - I may have another one for you … would you have a minute to look at it before the standup?
<https://content-qa5-origin.api.beachbodyondemand.com/v3/programs?isPseudo=false>
I’m looking at that now actually - I’ve got a ticket for it
There were changes to the schema
It’ll be included on today’s push
Right?
Agreed. I’ve brought it up to Vivek a couple times… I don’t know who owns that API but they need to be communicating changes
Kind of got the feeling he was doing that thing he does where he covers for anything Amrita may have done
It’ll likely have to wait until after the demo - but I just requested a new redeploy
Mainly these represent tickets from JIRA, but the schema changes should also effect algorithm results as well. For instance, I received a variety of 12 types of matches given the content from QA 5 and the new changes. Further input from Jaxon will likely increase this.
Hey  - we have a couple of tickets that just got assigned. They’re over at:
<http://jira.beachbodyondemand.local/browse/BR-2814>
<http://jira.beachbodyondemand.local/browse/BR-2815>
Yeah - such a rookie thing…. I committed from the wrong local branch that had a bunch of working code on it
Just trying to move too fast yesterday
I’m deploying dev4 and dev6 to try and test it out before scrambling to add it to QA5
If I was any more on your side - I’d need a Visa… I’m getting really sick of it as well.
Part of my frustration is really the whole “you go out and build it” … “we’ll deploy it” mentality as if the two things aren't really interrelated. More than half the time the issue has been a DevOps thing and in the last couple days Steve Lee and Vivek have been throwing us under the bus as if we controlled the whole thing. Like the other day when Sam was adamant that we get our bugs fixed without so it wouldn’t cause a delay… without mentioning that his team has repeatedly cost us half days at a time over merge issues.
We’re a “team” when it goes right…. and “the vendor” when it goes wrong? WTH
If I was in the south… and it were Sunday morning… this is when I’d pass the offering plate.
What do you think of just asking Vivek/Amrita to give me a code sample of how they would connect to the content API to get programs? Their other APIs have to have done it … if they can just point us to the code would it solve us trying to troubleshoot it from our end you think?
I’m all for winning - booting it up and playing w/ the guzzle request now
I think I’ve got it to work… but it’s not logging it how I was expecting
Hangout to see?
Shoot!
I was supposed to be on that too
Sorry
thanks
`programTitleSlug` is the field I believe we’ll be using and the data is wrong on their page links (as opposed to other things)
The code that I’m waiting on deployment for should address that particular field in terms of the key you use. So likely it’ll get pushed first. Though.. the data is probably still highly suspect
incorrect … like they’re just plugging data into that content admin area of WP without a ton of QR in terms of you you’ll be using it
Yeah ….  and  are planning to be very loud about it
/giphy shout it out
scared of how much you love it
There’s a few programs that shouldn’t be showing up but do. Either the flag is unreliable or the content is. I’m guessing content
There are
I just requested a redeploy …. there was an error thrown because of the difference between V1 and V3 data
Luck? You know a guy? You saw  kill a man?
You can always convert. They get to drink wine and wear white hats while driving around in small cars
Well… some of them do
At least one
Hmm… you’re seeing a blank page  ?
Awww…… That’s the best part!
Yeah - is it related to the convo in the bb-dev-ops-thunderbird channel maybe?
Ah
But he’s going to build the wall so I don’t have to do the things I don’t want to do  …. he promised. And I can tell you one thing about a man who’s been married 3 times and admitted to adultery with each one… he knows how to keep a vow
In other news - Dev6 is working now (so Sam has said) so I'm going to redeploy the BE for Dev6 (not sure about DB access tho). There's that FE issue still going on but perhaps that would be a good place to see what's up verses QA5 - I'll ping here when it's done
Last time we used your uber number
No one is in there tho
Is that Tealium issue w/ us?
I think they want to know for QA tonight
`<https://club-qa5.beachbodyondemand.com/results>` seems to show a non-Tealium related error too…. ```cannot read property event of undefined```
is it throwing an error, not giving you expected data, or does it look like content from the database is not changed?
I'll be in office in about 25 minutes - looks like I got out of jury duty too!
/giphy sad
I know that Sam and will Kray were going back-and-forth last night on some front-end configuration issues for Dev six, it might be related to that, and they might be the people best to know what's up now if so
Is there any way to know what deploys someone else may have done yesterday? If we can show they were touching that code, might help
On it :slightly_smiling_face:
If it helps… these are the only commits I could find deployed 2 days ago, on QA5 club ```
<https://github.com/beachbodydigital/bloody-mary/commit/8565ec4681fbe723ba7476c7d3e8f84a09cf699e>

We’re supposed to be on standup now…. But I think the QA5 issues are our only thing to report
Jump on? Or call it done?
`sudo delete real life conversations` … *claps hands together… “That oughta do it"
lol - is it us?
Currently - there’s an error with the communication between the onboarding API and the profiles API on QA5 in that the profiles API is jacked. So that’s sort of crashing onboarding
results
I don’t even
Okay… I’ll take a look. It’s working on local so it’s got to be something gone wrong when in their env
I figured it out. They changed the schema again
I’ll alert eddie to expect to see a new PR and 2 deploys (one FE and one BE)
Will do - I’ll have  with me too
So .. after Leads?
I think that’s what  and I were planning to do with him in Joan Clarke then… cool deal
Was thinking that - thx
Speaking to me in mean girls memes is the way to get my attention... :-)
Yup
Sorry - you still on?
I can hang up the phone
So… the net result with Matt was that the bug scrub this afternoon will let them know if they have everything they need to call it as ready or not
We’re thinking the same thing… :slightly_smiling_face:
not at all :slightly_smiling_face:
Cool - thanks man
There’s a bug scrub at 3pm where they’ll make the decision
In terms of “are we going to hit monday”… basically we’re down to (1) me working to revert to older APIs for onboarding and (2) matt working to get the analytics and other bugs fixed

Going to be able to make standup?
Yup :slightly_smiling_face:
We will be just a couple min late
jumping on in a sec
Don't know if ya'Il <!here|@here> saw this... but looks like we are live: <https://www.beachbodyondemand.com/onboarding>
ssssshhhhhhh
yeah - it's slow ... their 28 environments and 12 apis and 42 domains can sometimes slow it down
Just saw that - I'll take a look at it this afternoon. Not sure what's up







Do any of the devs know… I’m trying to answer a couple questions before I submit an estimate… Does Bloom have a CMS they use?
Gotcha… So Parse is like server… framework… CMS… all of it. Lovely
About to setup my local env for bloom… Anyone done this successfully and have tips? Anyone want to do this and want me to share how I got it up when I finish?
Didn’t think of that - I’ll check it out, thanks
<!here|@here> When you have some time… I’d love to maybe sit down and talk through Bloom… I keep running into some serious issues with their plan… need maybe 20 minutes
I’m free either before or after a 10:30 scrum
I’m thinking  and  as optional
deal
Okay :slightly_smiling_face: thanks
I’ll start on it this afternoon and by EOD tomorrow should have it at a place where  can start his work
Will do - Let’s plan to meet for just a few when that happens… I should be able to send some data your way to autofill those fields, so I’ll let you know what’s available on that page and you can do with it what you’d like :slightly_smiling_face:
When trying to log into SendOwl to create a test product.. I get this: "Couldn't log you in as '<mailto:bonnie@bloomforwomen.com|bonnie@bloomforwomen.com>'
Email is not valid"
/giphy it worked
Perfect :slightly_smiling_face:
In terms of their “products” sold, I have a couple questions… Do you happen to know any of these offhand ```
- Do they only sell subscriptions?
- If so, are they monthly and do they offer trial periods?
- Do they need to send money directly to an affiliate account on checkout or do they handle that on their own? ```
```
- Can I get either access to their Stripe acct or Test API keys for Stripe? ```
Awesome - thanks!
So I’ve got the code pretty much done (I think) but I kind of need a way to test it out… which makes me wonder how they’re deploying this? Would Danny be a good person to ask about this or does  know how they deploy it?
I’m wondering if they have a <http://parse.com|parse.com> cloud account that would probably answer this for me?
I should clarify… I’ve got the reworked signup process done… the “update my account” not so much, but that’ll be easy
Does anyone <!here|@here> know what the placeholders in the code for “multiplan page” stuff is … seems to conflict with some the direction they’ve given  and me on how they’re doing plans now, but I just want to make sure.
Thanks  ...  can you float the question to Bloom about what a “multiplan page” might be just to make double sure there isn't conflicting work happening.
^^ true
Dangit
JK - thanks :slightly_smiling_face:
Actually relieved… it seemed weird functionality given what they asked us to do so I was really hoping they hadn’t asked one of us to implement some multiplan page… and that asked another of us to redo their subscriptions :slightly_smiling_face:
In that case… I wouldn’t worry about it… might’ve just been old code from Tim
Only if it’s something they are actively doing, but I can’t imagine that’s the case
Does anyone know if there is a reason why `<http://dev.bloomforwomen.com/pages/members.php#enroll>` is broken? Looking into it now…
Hey -  … Sorry, I didn’t see this earlier… Are we good to do whatever we need to with the dev site?
Awesome - thanks!
So I’ve been trying to update the dev site to no avail… I’m just going to copy down their live site… push it back up to dev… and then checkout my changes made… either way, I think I’ve got a good handle on how this is going to effect the design…  What time do you head out today?
Cool deal - I’ll touch base before then :slightly_smiling_face:
So actually  I can just past these here... in terms of items for you that shake out of the reworked signup proces, I’m not 100% because I need to get in and test the flow, but so far it’s only ``` - Changing the step image at the top if we move from 4 steps to 3 (which we may not)
- Change some of the text/language for the buttons ``` I think that’s it… I don’t have anything more specific now… but I don’t think it’s anything more complex than that. I’ll let you know how it ends up, but I’d plan on it being all minor stuff like that.
yeah - I’d agree with ^^ Honestly I’d say wait… yes, there’s some stuff we can do to improve loading times now… but it’s going to be really minor…. and the biggest frustration he seems to have that he’s calling a “loading time” issue is technically not loading time…. it’s just parse
RE: private browsing… We can take a look… it may be one of a few things, some easy, some hard… I’d hate to say no without doing more research
do we have a login for bloom?
The one on the AWS sheet is outdated
RE: private browsing… it’s only on Safari… if the user goes Incognito Mode on Chrome, it works fine. That means it’s likely a Javascript issue would could take at least a few hours… possibly many more
In case anyone needs it for testing… <http://dev.bloomforwomen.com/> is now up to date with the main site (as far as I know… I literally copied everything over). I’ll be staging here
I’m testing the signup process now … I’ll know in the next couple hours exactly what changes we’ll need… it’ll be very minimal and as I rearrange the page I’ll take care of what I can while I’m there
Here’s the payment page w/in SendOwl for any given subscription… I’m allowed a logo upload and custom CSS upload. In order to get it up/running I threw some styles at it… but  if you wanted to login to their SendOwl account to change any of it… feel free. I can show you where it’s at if you get there. But here’s what I’ve initially done for the payment pages
So  … I was able to take care of any of the site edits (wrapping those up now) so if you want to check over the SendOwl payment page’s design, that should be it for us
… I sort of thought we were looking from input from Steven on how to proceed?
They’re using… <https://invisionpower.com/> … not sure if it’s hosted there or with them (they have 2 different plan options)…. if it’s hosted with <http://invisionpower.com|invisionpower.com>, there’s likely little we can do. If it is self hosted with bloom…. we’d have to jump in and edit this software they bought which (1) I’d feel super weird about and (2) I’d have no way of knowing how long that might take





Sure… though, I’m only thinking we should bid for Disqus (or something like it)… all other solutions, so long as Addo/Bloom still on Parse, are going to be extremely cost/time prohibitive
So if we use Disqus, there’s no backend to setup. It’s just on  to add it to the FE via an embed code for each course. I can help out if we need to dig into Parse to figure out where to add the code… so maybe I’d estimate 4 hours on my part **if at all**. But going this route is a mainly FE thing.
The two catches: (1) The catch is…. it’s not “single sign on” … so they’d need to “sign up” to Disqus in order to post a comment (even when logged in)
And (2) I’m not sure how the post structure works on Parse… so there may be some complexity there but  would know best…. maybe pad his time just a bit or at least let them know it might go over? But I think he’s right… shouldn’t be a big thing
While I have it up… looks like `templates/js/templates-modules.js` would be where you’d stick the embed code… if the URL changes with each module then I believe Disqus would register that as a new discussion for each module… but if so you’d only have to embed it there once
Either way… I think we’ll be on the lower end of that
So… I’m wondering if he means for this to be done in Parse or the WP site? Either way, I’m not sure how to do it. I looked through the Parse code.. and the only functions for the forum handle signing a user in… but not which group they are added to. If I could get login access to their forum, that may help me answer his question.
The login access in the AWS accounts sheet is outdated
No, sorry - it would be a login for this site: <http://community.bloomforwomen.com/admin>
Does anyone <!here|@here> know anything about a Bloom SSO plugin for the forum? Their site lists us as the author if it, but I don’t see a repo anywhere
To follow up on the Forum thing… I have no idea yet… I looked at the forum and will need to actually look at the source code on the server… looks like someone built a custom plugin for the forum that may control it
It’s a WP site, if that makes any difference. Let me know if you have any questions
That’s a good question. I’m thinking AWS. WP Engine was discussed before but I’d prefer to keep it w/ AWS, especially if for some reason we have to worry about putting this in a HIPPA compliant environment at some point.
^^^
So AWS sets up regions like (US-West, US-East) and they have some special ones for Government, Medical and so on…. I think basically the environment is the same in terms of how we interact with it, but there’s some beefed up security, data is a lot more segregated and they don’t offer all of their services in these regions. Plus access to it via open API systems is more controlled, I think. `<https://aws.amazon.com/health/providers-and-insurers/hipaa/>`
If you’re supposed to be HIPPA compliant… and you’re not in this or a similar environment… it’s like christmas for regulators :slightly_smiling_face:
No
Yeah… so they’re in this like… grey area of … technically, they’re offering therapy by licensed professionals… so Yes. But their online course ware stuff doesn’t need to be
Basically - it’s the fact that they call themselves “therapists” and then store customer information (including some sensitive stuff) on their servers
It’s likely one of those things that if we asked someone, like a regulator, they’d say “Yes, of course” … but since maybe no one has, and no one’s thought to… it’s not been an issue before.
Danny says they are more “educational” than “therapeutic” but they’ve not officially checked. I’d tend to agree, but “better to ask forgiveness than permission” seems a scary plan, lol
Since Meg &amp; Jen are both out today/tomorrow … … RE that meeting request from Addo/Eric …. have time today or tomorrow to take a look at it? I have a meeting w/ Bloom/Danny tomorrow here in person too but its very unrelated
Nor was I - but let’s meet and see what they need done. I’ve worked w/ Stripe’s API quite a bit - but something tells me this is less of a Stripe issue and more of an issue of their application logic and their business logic being way too highly coupled
I’m free 3-5pm today and then 10:30-noon &amp; 1-5pm tomorrow - how do those blocks of time work for you?
That’s right - thanks. I forgot we had that.
I think that’s safer … I don’t know that HIPPA is an issue, but I think they should be a bit on the safe side… cron jobs and stripe interaction worried me about WP Engine as well
No - no repo yet - I’ve just started working on it… Do you have permission to create repos?
I’m good with that…  might have opinions about if he wants resources stored in the /wp-content/uploads folder… like blog posts, that we’d perhaps want assets version controlled… but I like not including all the WP stuff
Cool - if you can create the repo… I’ll work locally and then just clone it to the repo later today once I have some stuff setup
Awesome - let’s take that and modify it to our needs…. there’s one I found here `<https://gist.github.com/salcode/9940509>` that even makes sure some of the default themes/plugins get ignored
jasonherndon86
Oh yeah - sorry… that’s it
:chillparrot:
I’m not sure what they have on AWS currently… their current site is hosted w/ Parse… but I think there are some AWS services they’re consuming
I’m planning to have more info for them on the HIPPA stuff by tomorrow - hopefully they’ll be able to make a decision on that. So ’s holding off since it might effect how we do it or the costs… but I’m developing locally so it’s not slowing me down
Nah - we’re good for a couple weeks on that :slightly_smiling_face:
Yeah - possibly. I’m about to jump into a couple meetings so i’ll likely be toward the end of the day… but I can definitely make that happen
Not at all :slightly_smiling_face:
I've got parts of it done... I need to add in their videos and skin the login... I was hoping by about Wed. to have it more fully done - then by the end of the week we could start sending it their way to review
But given my other work load - Bloom is mainly what I'm focusing on for the next couple weeks
BOD was a bunch of Hershey Kisses last week :wink:
But I got some good bloom work done around the edges (on planes) and late nights so... we lost a little bit of time - but not too much
So in looking at Thrive.... they have plugins and themes... we may be able to getaway with just using their plugins in our themes (I'm trying this now) ... which would be better because their themes are a bit ... not as cool. I'Il let you know how it goes
So yeah... all of the functionality that they want is contained in the plugins - so I've added those to the theme that I put together so as to maintain their look. Their support forums seem to indicate most people use them that way. If not, we can always go back and use one of their themes... but for now I'm going to move on to getting all of their content from their old database moved over into WP
We're good at the moment... it's mainly backend and what little FE there is is more translation of the site into WP which I've already done.... I've been working on something else here but I'Il be back on bloom shortly
Going well though - moving quickly ... I should have something for them to look at next week
Totally - thanks for the reminder ;-)
Sorry - been working on the apple pay stuff so I'm a bit behind on bloom ... but I've wrapped up most of my work with them now so I'm turning back to bloom more now
/giphy nooice
you've totally got me saying tha tnow
The update for me is that I finally got the CMN apple pay stuff launched so I'm going to turn back to this :slightly_smiling_face: ... as of now - I think that early next week I should have something for everyone to look at ... I'm just a few hours away from getting all their video content moved over and then I just have to configure the restrict content pro and we can start testing
Sure thing .... my calendar needs to be updated for that day, but if we avoid 9:30 - 12:30 I'm good :slightly_smiling_face:
Cool deal :slightly_smiling_face:
No - I should be good to do that ... it's mostly BE work since we're not redesigning it... when do we need that by again?
I can't begin working on it for a couple weeks ... I'm a bit swamped today so I'lll make a note to do that monday
Yeah - most all of the FE hookup work was done when I moved the theme over.
Can you double check with addo/bloom to see if they are going to be sharing an AWS account or not? We'Il want two instances of wordpress, two separate databases and such... I just don't know if they want them tied to the same AWS account or not?
That'Il effect where  sets it up - but they'Il be identical in nature
Coolio... so we will have two separate AWS accounts, each with a LAMP environment with wordpress installed :slightly_smiling_face:
^^ That's their current account info
I assume they want to change it cause Tim... but not sure if that's the right addres either
The payment method is an American Express ending in 1009 which belongs to Daniel Jackson ... I assume that's good to stay
<https://giphy.com/gifs/stargate-sg1-michael-shanks-12Bg2w75QbCrV6>
If we don't have a default way we do it - I'd think maybe we'd want them to be on it since it's them what's on the billing ... but I'm fine with it either way gov'ner
<https://giphy.com/gifs/van-poppins-seoulers-LW1wDJAmwg52M>
Also ... I'm hungry and tired
Absolutely!
Not to my knowledge - I would say start at maybe not the smallest size offered (I'm assuming we can easily scale that up if necessary) but on the medium/low side of it. They don't have a ton of data (or traffic - not usually more than 15 people during a day logged and viewed courses) ... but they log a bunch of stuff that if left alone could get bloated.... so something on the medium/low side of a DB makes sense I think
What are the options?
so.... a lot of choices, lol
Give me one sec to see what they have now :slightly_smiling_face:
Let's do 4 GB to start :slightly_smiling_face:
Coolio
I can't think of any reason why - but they've got some interesting connections to softwares we're not touching, so I'd say let's do it just to be safe
`sudo open all ports and post to facebook` ... got it :slightly_smiling_face:
somewhere in the ballpark of 20GB (or the closest to it) would be great. we're planning to store uploads on the server and their videos are hosted elsewhere so we're not using S3 for anything
And they don't do a ton of uploads
Yup
We probably just need to ask them to give us updated credentials - they're not going to know how to do this
Or - you could build one of those brute force bots to target their godaddy account and try to hack in... up to you really :wink:
fine.... :disappointed:

and I talked last week - and given that  and I are still setting up the environment, we're going to start slow with the more design-centric parts of QA today. Also - could you email the client re: access to the Stripe account - I need to import everyone's plan
sweet :slightly_smiling_face:
Thanks!
mmm.. food
Same password?
Username updated :slightly_smiling_face:
Also ... Stripe now has 2-Factor Auth... so... we're going to have to figure out how he can get us the text code quickly after we try to log in ... or he can disable 2-Factor Auth for the time being while we're working on it (my choice)
yo
From my end? No.  .... is there any work other than the WP migration going on w/ Bloom? just want to make sure  isn't using the dev environment before we point it somewhere else
Cool - thanks
I know ... wordpress is the pits 9 times out of 10 for me (don't tell Steven I said that, Iol) ... Awesome - thanks
I'm still seeing <http://dev.bloomforwomen.com|dev.bloomforwomen.com> redirect ... is that like a DNS propagation thing that will take time?
Yeah - jus redirects to the main site for me
54.244.154.67
Yeah .... on all of my devices/browsers it does it ... was thinking maybe it was a cache thing?
is it a hosts thing?
yup :disappointed:
I only use IE7 on my Mac... but it seems to be doing it for me on all the other "non-standard" browsers like chrome, firefox and safari as well
What should we be looking for? The WP install screen?
Cool deal
nope
Cool - thanks man :slightly_smiling_face:
Don't see it yet on my end ... we can check it in the morning
Yes :wink:
I see it :slightly_smiling_face:
Yes ... but not until about 4... working on something else at the moment that's time sensitive .... but I will do it then
Yes, we will have a DB to import
lol - I will make sure it doesn't overwrite anything
Okay - I will make sure I'm at 4.7 and those two values don't get written over
Good to know ... because that happens about 4/10, lol
Looking like probably closer to tomorrow morning (after the UAT setup ) before I can migrate over the site
Hey! Sorry - just been heads down on other stuff that's on fire .... hoping to get to this in the next couple hours
I may have accidentally broken bloom.... <https://giphy.com/gifs/BxWTWalKTUAdq>
I created a new branch... added the theme folder... and then merged into master... and now it's broke
Can't see how that would've broken it ... but it did, lol. Maybe something in Jenkins will tell us where the error was
For purposes of QA for me &amp;  ... could you ask the client for a list of features included in their basic membership plan versus their new membership plan ... they mentioned it in a meeting but I didn't write it all down
Sweet! Thanks '































































































































































































































































































































Just noticed as I've been jumping in ... if I go to <https://campbells.com> ... it redirects me to <https://www.campbells.com> ... if I go to <https://campbells.com/kitchen> it fails to redirect to <https://www.campbells.com/kitchen>... (the same is true for the other brand sites) not something we control since it's the DNS settings but just thought I'd mention it


































































































































































































































































































































































































































































I'm sorry .... the launch with apple is having a few hiccups... I'm sort of locked down into this at the moment... can I let you know when I'm free again and we can reschedule?
Okay - so sorry :disappointed:
Just starting on the codework for this... I've got to finish importing that data ... but I've got the code for new taxonomies done, and am digging into the collection API after lunch... so I'm moving along well
scrum update ^^
It only effects this if they don't want to do it at all or something ... I'm developing locally so it won't effect any rain/csc environments, and I could use the few extra days since I'm the noob
Given the timeline and his familiarity with the code base maybe we should just hand this off to Mario. I may loose a whole day here waiting to see what happens. ... Internal QA may be tight, but given my conversations with Mario yesterday, the timeline is still doable
For sure - I'Il be on
I'm back - catching up on missed work... but back
Does 1pm or 1:30pm MST time work better
I'm in a meeting at the moment - but it should be wrapping up in about 10 min
























































































































































































































I'm getting my environment setup

















































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































Do we know if the current cmnh site meets these criteria: ```
- PHP &gt;= 5.6.4
- OpenSSL PHP Extension
- PDO PHP Extension
- Mbstring PHP Extension```
Awesome.. thanks. They’re pretty standard these days but it’ll make a difference what framework I use
So I see this on the Pivotal page for the User API ```The app will need to be able to login users. It will also need to be able to register users so they can create campaigns in the app.```
This is the same user db and login as the main site, correct?
Absolutely… we’ll just have to tie it in to the WP auth then somehow… That will be the sticky part
Okay… I’ll grab some time w/  to figure out the data structure between the API and the website (Wordpress has it’s own way it like to authenticate) and then I’ll get back to you on that in a bit more detail
Awesome!
So  … here’s what I’m thinking for the setup…The API will drop data into the same database/tables that the WP site is… if I hash passwords in the same way that WP does, user auth can be shared without any issues about data loss
So… I need to get this put up on the media rain github account, add some unit tests and talk about a live deploy… but otherwise, here’s a first draft of the API done. <https://github.com/jasonherndon/cmnh-api>
yeah, I know all of those won't be terribly useful to you. They just took as much time to build as the others, and help with testing so I left them in. But that's good, I left off the route that ties the users to campaigns, thanks for catching that
Thanks again for the catch   … it’s up now <https://github.com/jasonherndon/cmnh-api#get-user-campaigns>
I was thinking the same thing in terms of the required fields on those create methods. I'll make sure the docs reflected this so it's easier to know upfront.
regarding the GET for hospitals, is that different than the GET for partners? The database table lists a fundraising entities table, and everything in there is what's being sourced for the partners. Or maybe partners is just a bad way to name it?
Ah! I see… I was thinking that they were one in the same - that a Hospital was a type of partner. So you need a GET for each then, correct?
I’ll get right on that… Steven created a repo on rain’s account, so I’m going to make that update, get it pushed up to our rain account, and then work to figure out how we can deploy. I’m assuming you’d love to have live endpoints whenever possible :slightly_smiling_face:
Good to know - thanks. If lack of live endpoints becomes an issue for you before I get it up… just throw something my way :slightly_smiling_face:
That new endpoint is up… as is the mediarain repo
<https://github.com/mediarain/cmnh-api>
Who would we talk to about getting this deployed on a development environment that  could interact with?
Yea - it’ll live on the same server… I might need to make a change to the db setup, but it’s looking for the local tables, same as the WP install
Sounds fun! :slightly_smiling_face:
So… Re the POST/CREATE Campaign …. that would mean that only the title is required, correct?
Also… re: `list of donors and amount they donated` … let’s wait for the legal team on this… just in case. But it’s easy enough to add in
Could you add me to that as well? Would love to know as much as I can about the deployment plan for the API :slightly_smiling_face:
Gotcha :wink:
Yup - thanks for that :slightly_smiling_face:
So… including the user, this is what I have… look right to you? ```
        $validator = $this-&gt;validate($request, [
            'User_ID' =&gt; 'required|numeric',
            'Name' =&gt; 'required',
            'Photo' =&gt; 'required',
            'Donation_Hospital' =&gt; 'required|numeric',
        ]);
``` There’s a field called ‘Campaign_Type’ which is likely going to be required. It’s a flag in their DB, but I’ll probably just hard code that in the API for this version.
Yes, those are all I have as required atm. Everything else is optional, even the domain amount.
May be able to help here too… seems like from their database they tend to have a dedicated folder on their WP site where we pull related images from… So something like… ```wp-content/app-campaign/images/header-sized-so-it-doesn’t-look-weird/
  - Image1.jpg
  - Image2.jpg
  - Image3.jpg
``` If these are loaded thru WP, each will have associated IDs which we can pass back/forth and easily predict the URLs for… if they were uploaded manually, they won’t (I think) and we may need to use the URL and filename itself.
A GET to /hospitals
Let me know when you have that quick chat? Love to listen - the API will need to validate what the app is sending
for a campaign, the ID field on their DB called “CampaignID” … and the response you get back is the full entity. So it would be an object on your end, I’m assuming (not sure how hydration works with iOS)
Coolio. So here’s the object you’d get back as a JSON response for the successful completion of a Campaign ```
{
  "Campaign_ID": 63,
  "User_ID": 34,
  "Name": "New Campaign Name",
  "Campaign_Type": "Other Creative Activity",
  "Headline": "Here's a really cool headline.",
  "Mission_Statement": "Here is our totally awesome mission statement.",
  "Donation_Goal": "400",
  "Donation_Hospital": "2077",
  "End_Date": "1992 - 10 - 11 T20: 11: 41 + 0000",
  "Photo": "",
  "Paused": "0",
  "created_at": "2016-10-17 17:38:40",
  "updated_at": "2016-10-17 17:38:40”
}```
Note: the `Donation_Goal` and `Donation_Hospital` would be integers, not strings (just a result of my local setup)… Also, the Photo would be either an ID or an image resource
Actually, scratch that  … was using the wrong table :slightly_smiling_face: … so that endpoint/response will change. Though you’ll still be getting the entire entity back
For any of our devs <!here|@here> using the following tables from the DB… these will change in the coming two weeks. These specific tables will be pulled from another DB on the same server… DM me if you need the credentials ```
UWXRUDYEZS...PostalCodes
UWXRUDYEZS...SubMarkets
UWXRUDYEZS...Markets
UWXRUDYEZS...Television
UWXRUDYEZS...RadioStations
UWXRUDYEZS...Celebrities
UWXRUDYEZS...Hospitals
UWXRUDYEZS...FundraisingEntities
UWXRUDYEZS…Champions```
To the website?
Yeah - we’ve got the api up… I’m just going to start testing it… but the api doesn’t actually log anyone in
Strike that
the last part … `the api doesn’t actually log anyone in` … there’s an Auth route I forgot to put up…. let me run through and test it and send you everything you need for it later today
that’s what I mean… the auth route would be to authenticate and log in a user
<http://api.childrensmiraclenetworkhospitals.org/>
If we’re passing a number - I’d love an integer instead. Do we have those resources already made? If so I can put them up
Cool deal - if that’s what  wants me to use then I can put it up
I’ve got the API deployed and while the API is working… there’s just some differences in their databases that are kind of making the data wonky. Wonky is an official work. Soo…. it’ll probably be tomorrow morning before I get this out to you
I mean… those images are all right. If you wanna play it safe. But why not blow their freaking minds and throw in a: <http://goldrattooth.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/mauriziocattelan2115_1.jpg>
I’m sorry. It’s late in the day. Those images are great - thanks
As an update for today: we’re at a point where the API is up and running on their server (minus the endpoint that gets all the donors for a campaign which we’re waiting to hear back from legal on - is there any work on that yet?). So  will be working on integrating/testing the live endpoints into the app…. I’ll wait to hear back from legal to get that last endpoint up… and  will be working on the web page and the stripe integration … does that sound about right guys?
Sweet! Then I’ll have that endpoint up. Thanks for helping me catch that
Let me know if you need anything from me - I’ll be OOO all week
Was it approved by legal, tho?
:grin:
Totally - thanks :wink: I’ll have that endpoint up tomorrow
Do were have an update on where we are at w/ the Stripe integration?
Thanks :slightly_smiling_face:
We have to update them by tomorrow on that - and we have until the end of the week on it - just so you're tracking on that too
I will have that donors endpoint up to you today by the way :slightly_smiling_face:
Awesome - let me know how I can help :slightly_smiling_face:
I’ll have that endpoint for you tomorrow actually  … I need to ask  how we’re relating users to a donation in the database
I don’t see it in there currently
Thanks :slightly_smiling_face:
Nick Ward was who was asking that we check in on that since Apple had given them a deadline
I believe so
no - not the app... Apple just wanted an update on the stripe integration
We said we'd check in with Nick by today
I have it
Sorry - I mean Nick Ward has it and can give it to you :slightly_smiling_face:
Cool deal :slightly_smiling_face:
Working on getting the API endpoint up for the donors list... we're showing a list of donors, are they sorted by donation or by donor? Meaning if I gave twice, each for $10, does it show my name twice with $10 next to each, or once with $20 next to it?
I'd have it both ways.... just in case... but yeah - it'Il be available as a `donors` object within the campaign details
Updated the API with a route to get the donors of a campaign - as well as added the donors to the campaign details object - <https://github.com/mediarain/cmnh-api#get-appcampaign>
k - pushing live now
Absolutely - that's included
Cool - it's updating on the site now so it will be ready for you. just let me know if you run into any issues
I was just going off of what the fields were on the DB that was currently live - but there's more to add coming from the app, let me know and I can add it onto the database and the API
I'll take a look at those fields, thanks (won't you also need to send a user ID?). And you're right, the campaign ID isn't one you have to set when sending the create post - but you'll get it back in the response. It auto creates.
And I can give you back a fully formatted URL - forgot about that one, thanks.
Yup ;-)
Okay - let me check on that. I've been back/forth on other projects here so much I don't wanna talk out of turn :slightly_smiling_face:
Yes - only the email and password truly matter - everything else you can send in the extras field and I'Il always return it back to you
There's a bug on the auth - but I'm working on it and will have it fixed in a few minutes. I'Il update the app campaign to return the URL so that you will have both things to start working on today
As far as I understand it - the web doesn't validate those fields.
yes - it stores them, and uses them on the web later... it just isn't picky about it
- So I've fixed the auth ... you can register a new user and then hit the auth route with that new user. The campaign create also now includes the URL in response (as well as the donors as an object)
let me know if you need any info on connecting Stripe to the site... I have acces to the DB and can help you test things... Mark can too but I know he's "off the project" :slightly_smiling_face:
Yeah - we will need to test the payment going through as successful with stripe and also within that same lifecycle have a way to update the website database. In terms of flow I think it would be ```
- Javascript call to Stripe API to grab the token
- Customer/Payment is submitted to Stripe
- On successful payment from Stripe, log it into the database
- ?? do we send something back to the App here? I would assume so
```
Did we get the keys from CMN to test in their Stripe account?
Sorry - I'm not in until Monday
When you say ```All we need to do is the following in an api:``` Are you thinking the web page? Or were you planning on sending the payment logic to the API itself?
I'm a little unsure of what Randall needs - I think I might need some clarification from him in terms of where he's sending the request.
Okay Don/Yuliya
Dualiya sounds like a perfume
that makes sense, I was thinking we were processing the payment on the web, and sending the receipt of the transaction to the API, but if we want the API to handle it that's OK too. Can you give me an idea of the files and functionality that will be using from the theme? Handling billing and updating the database may be easier to do with  out the theme files, depending on what sort of functionality is needed
Thanks  ... today is going to be a bit of a rush with meetings and travel with me... so if anyone needs anything let me know but I might be somewhat less responseive
Very ;-) All of the endpoints are in the wiki and they're all working online and should represent all of the data you need (to my knowledge - though let me know if you need anything else with it)
Okay - just looking through their Auth now... my code for authentication is working - but the password hashing method I'm using is slightly different than theirs... Once I figure this out I'Il have an update out real quick to the API
Pushing the auth changes live now.. then moving on to the payment integration this morning.
<!here|@here> With the flu shots starting at 10 - is everyone good with a 10:30 standup still? We can just grab a side room for a few minutes
With the payment, are you giving me the total amount in cents or dollars? Just wondering if I need to do the conversion or if you do it on your side.
Cool - thanks :slightly_smiling_face:
I had to step out of the office for a few minutes, but I'll be back in about half an hour if you want to sit down and try a couple transactions through stripe to see if they post
Forgot I had a standup in a few - does around 2:45 work for you?
I've got to jump off of this to do a couple things before I head out for the day .... but tomorrow I will be focused on adding an authorization header to the API for your requests so we can test that out together once I get it up. If you run into any other issues/questions with the API just feel free to leave it here in the main slack channel and tag me. I will be working tonight from home a bit
Cool deal :slightly_smiling_face:
working through the testing of the payment ... then I'Il switch to that once it's done
<!here|@here> I won't be able to make scrum because of a meeting conflict ... we can probably just update over slack... but my update is that I've got the API complete except for the testing w/  for payments.
Nick Ward has sent an email out to a couple of devs from Stripe who may be able to help us out with the script. They've not reached out yet but if we haven't figured it out by then I'Il connect us all. That needs to be done quickly so let me know how I can help. I will be in office until noon today and tomorrow and then available by slack/phone in the afternoon.
As in the computer verifying the developer account with the device?
I've got the test phone linked with my computer now... not really sure how... but I'm going to run through testing this.
What was the repo / branch that you were working on?
We're finishing up the payment portion to deliver to apple this morning so after that the database should be populated with a number of donations to a given campaign so we can test that out.
Including this week? Or after this week?
An additional 8 for me
I have a quick change to make to the apple pay page - and then maybe after company meeting we can take a look at it together real quick just to make sure I'm not missing anything before we send it on to the client?
<https://childrensmiraclenetworkhospitals.org/applepay-donation/?appCampaignId=25>
I posted these in the wrong channel... not sure if it's best for  or   ... here's the css changes I'd like to make ```
- Let's to go ahead and change the border color of the Apple Pay button to `#d1d2d4`
- Can we add a rule that changes the cursor on hover?
- When I view the page in chrome `<https://childrensmiraclenetworkhospitals.org/applepay-donation/?appCampaignId=25>` the apple pay button is loading (but is blank) - can we fix that?```
That link was for mark at the moment ... we're not quite ready for QA - but we'Il ping  when we are :slightly_smiling_face:
Awesome - thanks... sorry, thought it was in reply to the link :slightly_smiling_face:
When we're done with those CSS changes, let me know and I can get it ready to send to CMN, they'd like Apple to test the page today
Awesome! Can you do a PR for it and then we'Il merge it into master and copy it to live at the same time?
Okay ... can we huddle for a few <!here|@here> in a room and figure out what's left?
Is everyone <!here|@here> free at 2:30 for a quick 15 minute sync up ... I'd love for everyone to hash out what they need for each of us and who's doing what
Okay
free now?
Which endpoint doesn't work?
`Donor list doesn't work, but everything else is done` ... sorry - thought that was for me :slightly_smiling_face:
OMG - going to fast ... totally thought this was my DM w/ you :slightly_smiling_face:
Nick is wanting to know if we can go live to test live - out of sandbox - any reason we can't?
Ah ... my bad then ...
So that's on the app site... from the web site side ... we don't need to worry about that. The two are not linked.
<!here|@here> We'Il skip scrub today as after yesterday afternoon's meeting I'm sure we all know what we're up to... reach out to anyone if you get stuck or need anything.
The URL for a given photo resource looks like this ... `<https://cdn.putyourmoneywherethemiraclesare.co/images/appcampaigns/campaignHeader1@3x@1x.jpg>` ... But for each image there are multiple versions ...
@1x, @2x, @3x ... which would you like?
Or should I just give you the URL w/o those and let you decide?
That's right - thanks. So it would be only the web that uses the URL - the app just needs the resource ID
thanks
Thanks - I'Il rename them
So those photos are available at `<https://cdn.putyourmoneywherethemiraclesare.co/images/appcampaigns/campaignHeader1@3x@1x.jpg>` Where the ID from the Photo column in the database is swapped for the first number `campaignHeader1`, `campaignHeader3`, etc.... Each comes in 3 sizes... feel free to pick whichever works best as a HTML link. Given the design, I don't think we need to scale these with CSS
So given that the photos are bundled with the app, that means that in the future if we added more photos we'd need an app update, correct?
Gotcha - just checked Zapier and I thought there was a thumbnail on the webpage ... so which photo size do you need in the meta data or do we include all three and let the app decide?
Thanks - thanks. I think we'Il add the full image object, the title... should we do anything for the description?
Also site_name may be good to add
So if we used the smaller image... this would be the proposed meta data that would feed what the user sees in iMessage.... ```&lt;meta property="og:image" content="https://cdn.putyourmoneywherethemiraclesare.co/images/appcampaigns/campaignHeader'.$APP_CAMPAIGN_ID.'@1x@1x.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;meta property="og:image:type" content="image/jpeg" /&gt;
&lt;meta property="og:image:width" content="338" /&gt;
&lt;meta property="og:image:height" content="203" /&gt;
&lt;meta property="og:title" content="$CAMPAIGN_NAME_GOES_HERE" /&gt;
&lt;meta property="og:description" content="$WHAT_SHOULD_THE_DESCRIPTION_BE??" /&gt;
&lt;meta property="og:site_name" content="$Give_Miracles??" /&gt;
``` So I have questions about ... What should the Description and Site name be? Are those pixels sizes good or should we use a bigger size? We can test this by sending a link in iMessage to make sure those fields populate, correct?
.... if you can help me fill in any of those gaps that'd be awesome
So that assumes that all campaigns are events... if we can customize this (it may just pull the url as the description) we'd probably need to find something generic ...  and I will play with it and if it's something we can control, we'Il clear it with Nick
Let's start with the following. If description get's overridden, we'Il know we can't set it and remove it. If not, we'Il clear the lingo with Nick. Same with site name ```&lt;meta property="og:image" content="https://cdn.putyourmoneywherethemiraclesare.co/images/appcampaigns/campaignHeader'.$APP_CAMPAIGN_ID.'@1x@1x.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;meta property="og:image:type" content="image/jpeg" /&gt;
&lt;meta property="og:image:width" content="338" /&gt;
&lt;meta property="og:image:height" content="203" /&gt;
&lt;meta property="og:title" content="$APP_CAMPAIGN_NAME" /&gt;
&lt;meta property="og:description" content="Join us at this event and donate to a great cause!" /&gt;
&lt;meta property="og:site_name" content="Give Miracles" /&gt;```
^^
Sure thing - just looking for a user they can log in with that already has campaigns created that have donations associated with them?
Did anyone just create the user "Craig Sorenson"?
Okay - just wanted to know if it was one of us or not - otherwise I'd stay away from using any of his data when populating dummy data
If this is for Nick Blain's request (if not, sorry) but perhaps Branden can give us screenshots from the app
Gotcha. In that case ....
/giphy nevermind
sweet - I'Il drop those on the site now - thanks
I don't think I pushed any changes - but I'Il check it out - thanks
Are you able to set a partner id?
Also ... for a partner ID ... try 32 ... and for a hospital ID.... try 2077 ... if you're using hospitals/partners that aren't real it may not be returning them in the response, but saving them to the database nonetheless
^^
Okay - my apologies ... That's what the wiki shows and what the code had to a point ... but now it's Hospital_ID ... you're right. I'd like to use Hospital_ID going forward since that's what the already existing database uses ... sorry for not communicating that earlier
I'm not sure what you mean - sorry
He left before I could ... but that probably because the link should be <https://childrensmiraclenetwork.com/appcampaign/?appCampaignId=25>
The CSS will need some adjusting before we're ready to test it out ... I will have that in a few hours
Sorry - just noticed the domain was incorrect... It's ```<https://childrensmiraclenetworkhospitals.org/appcampaign/?appCampaignId=25>```
or ```<https://childrensmiraclenetworkhospitals.org/appcampaign/?appCampaignId=3>``` if you want to test smaller donations you can enter one in
But again - the testing will need to wait a couple hours.
As well - the apple pay will only work from safari with card in the apple wallet
The incorrect domain was an error on my part ... it's been fixed now
the password on that page is `givemiracles`
updates to the site/api?
I'm working on finishing them now
Can we do scrum <!here|@here> on slack today guys? ... let's just post what you're working on, any blockers, and when you're likely to be complete with your task? Just so we're all tracking on the same page... :slightly_smiling_face:
Sweet - I'Il upload them shortly
That's not the final URL. We will be dropping the applepay- from the URL when we go live. The current page is password-protected so that's probably why it's not showing up
Sorry you're not feeling well  ! I've got the everything done so far on my end - let me know when we're ready to test the donations for each donation type and I'Il go through those
We will want to add that `Stripe_Transaction_ID` into the DBs as well for the other giving types
No - I sent you the PRs yesterday that represented all of the changes I had that were on the web site
bar.length &gt; 0
That should be what's on the site now I believe
Sorry - let me know if there's anything else I can help with
Okay - about to run into a couple meetings - I will test around 10
I just put together a PR for a small style change ... <https://bitbucket.org/cmnhdigitalmarketing/childrensmiraclenetworkhospitals.org/pull-requests/7/lets-add-some-padding-to-that-btn-bruh/diff> ... but apple pay for app campaigns worked well on desktop and mobile. What's the best way to test for other types - just change the GET param in the URL?
Thanks - I'Il test these all out
I'm uploading those on the server now
For go live... as far as I know ... we just publish a page called `donation` with the same data as the `applepay-donation` page ... and then I'Il make that change in API so the url gets build correctly .... as far as I know that's all we're doing... correct?
Sorry - got distracted :slightly_smiling_face:
Should work now
Is that donation page live? Or scheduled to be published?
Ah - I see what you're saying ... both pages are live and it's the shortcode that needs to change
So ..  ... we will need to coordinate that change (and the API one) with the launch on monday morning .... that's what I'm thinking, no?
Sweet! - sounds good
Does Nick know?
Cool deal


Nick B is asking when the link to the app will go live - I'm assuming after it's passed review, no?
I think they were expected it to be released at 10am - is there a possibility it won't?
totally :slightly_smiling_face:
whew!
knew it!


Okay - I can take a look at it today, that's on the API side. Maybe let him know we will get back with him early afternoon?
I see the info in the DB - which means it's likely an issue with the API or the APP ...  - what was the authorization key for the API? I don't have it on this comp
Yup :slightly_smiling_face:
Thanks!
Yeah - it seems something is up with the API - wanted to make sure I had the latest auth key from code since I didn't commit it
Seems to be something on the API side ... I will take a look at it
When you get a chance ... could you point me in the direction or send me the updated receipt email for the donations?
So the API seems to be back up/working ... donations work over the web and all that ... but I'm not able to authenticate within the app to check it out fully... Auth seems to be working when I hit the API so if you could take a look and try it out, that would be awesome :slightly_smiling_face:
Are you getting into the app though?
So I know that `<mailto:jasonherndon86@gmail.com|jasonherndon86@gmail.com>` with the password `snuffles` should sign you in and have campaigns with donations
Yeah - let me see ... the hydration coming out of the new db for that is wonky
Okay ... so this is going to get funky... auth is working now .... but other stuff isn't .... I'm going to got through the app and convert all the those ids to ints manually .... it's a bit hacky ... but it's all we have
hacky as in sub-optimal code and may slow it down if they get thousands of users at a time... but not unsafe
I think I've troubleshooted all of the calls except 3 from within the app: the create campaign, the list of current campaigns ... and maybe payments... if you can offer any more insight on either of those that would  help me narrow it down
Ah!
It's cool ... this helps :slightly_smiling_face:
when getting a campaign ... what about ```    "Hospital_ID": 0,
    "Partner_ID": 0,
    "Photo": 1,
    "Donation_Amount": 0,```
are those values ints or strings?
Okay - we're done!
Creation / viewing campaigns works ... donations work.... emails were updated .... I just tested everything out ....
Like that?
totally :slightly_smiling_face:
yup
sweet!
soooooooo glad that's done
It was super fun ... I just mean I'm glad the fire has been put out :slightly_smiling_face:
I'm hoping .... I'Il have something to look forward to in January when I get back

Does this mean I’m going to have to purchase a license, lol

Yes… Unix meaning the seconds since the EPOCH… which when the computers take over will be called “the second big bang"
And yes - the string would be ISO format, I suppose… I’m voting UNIX
@thetraitor … I mean   … I see your point :slightly_smiling_face:
So my specific use case for this is that I need to verify that a user twenty-one or older, only once, and then likely never do anything with the birthday again. So since I’m using the epoch to compare the birthday to 21 years ago from the current date, I just stored that object, erring on the side of cleaner code/performance and not converting it to another time format again (not that the .0004 seconds would kill it)… but it just made me curious what the pref was for you guys out there :slightly_smiling_face:

Anyone <!here|@here> used the AWS Hippa compliant cloud before? <https://aws.amazon.com/health/providers-and-insurers/hipaa/> … wondering if it’s just a specialized region w/ different offerings or if it’s something that you have to interact with differently
Okay - yeah… that’s sort of what I was thinking, though I thought it was it’s own region you could place resources on, similar to the govcloud
But I think the way we’d interact with it is the same
Nope - you’re right. Government is a region, Health isn’t. Seems odd tho
What if you’re a government health agency….? :slightly_smiling_face:














I saw a proposal for this once that used RFID ... they knew what was in a given cart.
Or in this case, hand
From a comment on the engadget site: "Looks more like Japan's open-by-default barriers (they close on you if you don't scan in) rather than UK's closed-by-default barriers (you have to scan/insert ticket for the barrier to open)." ... so maybe the near field cell phone tech?

A question for those who have done Alexa dev <!here|@here> .... How often would you say that Alexa fails to map to an Intent. For example, if I have
```dog
cat
horse```
listed as intents and ask the question "What's your favorite animal?" and the user responds with "snake".... how likely is Alexa to try to match "snake" to one of those three, verses kicking off to something like a "I didn't understand that response, could you try again?"
So if we had to be super sure that we only progressed with the correct information, we'd have to add some kind of a feedback loop of "did you say?" and then try again?
I'm having convo's with UX, and it seems that Alexa's desire to map to an intent can cause issues if she get's it wrong... just wondering what the best practice is to lessen the likelihood of that

About to purchase a font (Gotham) from <http://Typography.com|Typography.com>… Does anyone <!here|@here> know if Rain has an account with them that we use? Or if/how I should set one up tied to a more general email address for us?
So if the font account is listed on the spreadsheet and we have (or purchase) access to a web font for use with a client project (and then charge the client for the font) …. are we good to use it for other things?
Makes sense… do you have a preference for/against web fonts versus buying the .ttf version and using them locally with each project? Does that make it easier/harder for you? I know the license is a bit more I think.
Okay… so it sounds like I’ll ask the producer to purchase the font using the account listed in the spreadsheet.. thanks

True. Monday/Tuesday for me this week suck but generally they’re good days





I’ve got to be out early today, so I won’t be joining this. However, assuming you’re still going to Mo’s, I’d like someone to order the pork and chicken, 2 meat platter in remembrance of me. You may draw straws for who for who has the privilege of paying for this meal. This must be placed at the table in front of an open seat and the meal should preferably begin with each person pouring out a bit of their rice on the ground in salute to me. If you choose another side besides rice, this can be poured out on the ground as well… I don’t want to be a bother.
We doing lunch-krew every week as the invitation suggests? Or every other week as the invitation once suggested?
I’m game either way as well… we can see what the other members of the krew say.
I’m going to tell you what I told everyone in high school... I will literally do whatever the majority of people want to do.

Slack should come w/ some kind of voting mechanism
lol - if I don’t vote for both, that one doesn’t show up… I didn’t want people to be confused
Thanks for the idea…. forgot about slack integrations… it’s a whole new world!
There are no hanging chads on slack  :slightly_smiling_face:
So unless there’s a sweeping number of people saying otherwise… I’m hearing that in general, every 2 weeks is good… but also today people want to grab lunch.
Honestly… I understand slack voting about as much as I do the Electoral College.
I agree with the lunch krew mini approach
It would be funny if we did that… build a slack integration that allowed you to divide a channel into teams based on profile information… giving each team a weight that is determined by the size of the group… and each poll is calculated based on that weight… and then when we ask if anyone wants to go to lunch at JDawgs or Cubbys… and Hillary Clinton wins.
Thai Drift?
Lunch krew soon?
Anyone on a call or something? I’m ready anytime
Or the invite says 12:30… whatever :slightly_smiling_face: I’m missing everything today

Sounds fun! What CMS is it?… and can I grab a login for it?
So Cake.php was the framework?
^^
Cool deal
And… best Github branch to fork/branch off of would be dev?
Sweet
I was going to ask about a deployment strategy… but I saw FTP credentials in the AWS sheet :wink:
So when cloning the repo I get this odd error… but it only seems to be effecting the /aguacate folder… don’t think that I need to touch that, right?
So… I found the error. There’s a constant set w/in the application that limits the amount of navs to 6. I’ll have new code pushed to Github shortly… on dev
Should I merge into master? Upload to FTP? Not sure how they want to deploy the new code?
Also - the way that their code is written, without a much larger refactor, I have to hardcode in the number of links they want to use.   - Are we for sure it’s just the one on each side they want to add?
To clarify… I can set the max number allowed on the left… then all others go to the right. That “max number” has to be hardcoded.
I’m out today around 4… Jen asked if I had time today/tomorrow… I don’t know if that means that the site needed to be updated by then, or not? I can wait to push the code to dev on Github until you get word back from the client.
Could you refresh my memory… I forget where we landed last week. We said I was good to just FTP up the new code, correct?
Awesome - thanks.
The good news is… we found a time machine. The bad news is… it only works on this website.
In that case, unless something funky happens when I try to FTP the new code or add the link… I think we’ll be up by the end of day.
No… the website is up. There will be a tiny downtime on the site… later today, I’ll swap one file for another… the site menu will break for a few seconds… and then it’ll be fixed
Absolutely - That’s the content I was planning to use today when I update the site, is that good to go or do we need to give them any heads up?
So with the help of  … the fix is made… their site is updated :slightly_smiling_face:


























































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































I'll be working from home this morning before a doctors apt and then in the office around lunchtime. I'll be on available if anyone needs anything.
Hopefully not in the "Investigators searching for arsonist after another suspicious fire in Farmington” video...
Which means w/ the 5th being labor day that’s a 4 day weekend, no?

That’s nearly exactly what that sounds like!






We'll miss you  - don't be a stranger

I will be working from home Thur/Fri afternoon - but I'Il still be available for any meetings/calls and on slack/email/phone.


and I were going to hit up Rio ?
fo shizzle










So it seems internets are down here - just a heads up ... I'm open for any tips on how to fix that. I keep saying "Alexa, fix internet".... but ... nothing
My daughter is sick so I'll be working from home tomorrow to take care of her and available around the edges. Let me know if you need me.


I'll be back in office tomorrow - my son had a quick trip to the hospital today to see if he needed eye surgery. He's doing okay, if not a bit shaken up - but ,  and  said he could have their dogs and we've already told him about that so he's super happy making plans for all three to join our family. See you tomorrow ... kthxbai!
I know for a fact  that that just cost the taxpayers of Utah $243,093 dollars ... not like it bothers me tho, I converted all my money to yen
I could've been thinking about it in Yen
Related question ... what if you hit the "alarm" button by accident yesterday (not that I did that)? Does that call 911? Does it do anything?
Not sick just wanted to say I'd be in a little later this morning - our sitter had a thing.
My stomach is burning and my eyes are bleeding, is that what everyone else is feeling?
Also, Im not sure this is related, but I can now speak to most animals. Is that common with anthrax?


Thanks - it is beautiful!
I forgot that I had someone coming by my place to do some work... and now they're there! So I'm going to go home and finish the day from there ... if anyone needs anything then that's where I'Il be :slightly_smiling_face:

















































































































































































The notes that Nathan is referencing is the same notes I put together in a shared Google doc w/  and  when we met after I came onto the project. I'll invite you to it when I'm back at my computer - it would be good to regroup around that as the next few action items were on your side so I'm sure with you coming on that has probably shifted a bit.




































































In terms of associations.... can we say that the following are true? ```App users have goals that belong to a category. 
Each goal has notes.```
Also - are the users creating the categories - or are they preset?
^^ categories?
Does it make any difference to you making 4 small calls versus 1 larger call and caching that? If you prefer the smaller calls I will just make sure we pay close attention to the speed of the API so that the user doesn't experience any lag
Given the amount of data - and the realistic number of goals that a person would have .... it seems to make sense to me to, for example, group all the notes with the goals call... and group all the goals with the categories call ... should cut down on server load, the number of calls you have... since each object is fairly small should still be fast
Totally
Yeah - and some of the duplication of goal/note info (or figures like the number of goals active) would all be available to you so we'd trim down on the database too

Me like. :slightly_smiling_face: I think I've got everything I need in order to build that database and endpoints ... I'm going to use Laravel (vs Lumen) for the build so we have a bit more robust-i-ness and can do things like mailing the user, manage notifications and such. But that's further down the road

FYI - I’ll be putting together the technical architecture document for this project (thanks  for the examples of previous Alexa projects). I’ll post it here so everyone, especially  and , can review it. Will have that done before EOD Monday. From there, we can regroup for next steps on the technical side. Thanks!
Thanks
I was thinking that…  and I setup some time tomorrow to go over a dev plan and I was going to put it together after that. I was thinking something more than a weekly dev scrum but less than a daily dev scrum… maybe twice a week scrum
Working on the technical architecture document… just got backed up with another client today. I’ll be posting that tomorrow morning for anyone interested.
<!here|@here> is the Technical Architecture document for this skill. It’s really basic (no user auth, api integration, etc), leaving the user flow through the application to the other documents. I’d especially love your thoughts,    since I’m an Alexa noob
Is part of your thinking there b/c of the simple nature of the app it’s a good way to test out the alexa-sdk on something simple?
Tomorrow sounds good to do that.  and I are meeting today to go over a plan for how we tackle the dev
Awesome - thanks for ‘splaining that to me :slightly_smiling_face:
Thanks for the feedback - I left a couple comments as well
We’re storing the user info in Dynamo DB from the companion app
Also - I’m adding a section now for the Auth flow.  informed me we can’t `post` from an age gate, so we’ll need to push the account linking screen to the companion app
Analytics added - there’s just that one pending comment w/ you &amp; Meg over the pending SOW…. can I just reword that to take out the reference to the SOW itself. Not 100% sure it’s necessary
I’m referencing the Technical Architecture document, sorry if that wasn’t clear :slightly_smiling_face:
Done
Great! I just used the same info we used on the Yahoo skill, it looked pretty boiler plate… so I can merge those into it for sure
/giphy it is finished
Do we have any licenses to Photoshop or the CC?
With the Age Gate, I’m only seeing one page. From this, and the flow diagram, I take it there’s no success/error pages. We just handle validation of the form from within that page and then send them along their way if they’re old enough? Just wanted to confirm since some of our other skills have had these pages before... but I don’t believe they’re necessary here.
I think I’m good at the moment… I’d rather not have us purchase one to not use it so I can just wait and see if it becomes a thing. Thanks tho
Awesome - thanks
On the Skill-Creative-Assets-List… I see a line for their privacy policy and the terms page… but I’m not seeing these links in the design. Is that right, or should we raise that w/ Weber?
/giphy you-got-it-dude
Sounds good… looks like we’re waiting on Weber to confirm those links anyway. Might be good to note somewhere, even if they’ve confirmed those are the pages to use, that we’re sure the content is what they want in the app. I only ask because I see that the year and contact email for an actual person is hardcoded… as opposed to being dynamic… so they might be out of date :slightly_smiling_face:

In the AWS account sheet, I see the names for the DynamoDB tables … in which account were these made?
Sorry… was looking in the wrong region :slightly_smiling_face:
/giphy my bad
For the DynamoDB setup … could we change the table names to from “ultra95” to “ultra95Prod” and “ultra95-dev” to “ultra95Dev” and then change the primary key for each to be a “accessToken” which is a string
Similar to the yahoo setup, they have the “primary partition key” set to “userId” which is a string
Yes.. the primary key needs to be a sort key
`accessToken` is what I’m thinking we’ll call it
Actually… and I could be totally wrong here… but I think I misspoke
In looking at the Yahoo Setup… they have the ```Primary partition key = userId (String)
Primary sort key = -```
So we’ll probably want to do the same… only instead of userId it’ll be `accessId`
Awesome! Thanks
I see the Ultra sort key is set to `- (String)` and the Yahoo sort key is set to `-` … is there a way to update the Ultra one to match?
Can we null that baby out?
Not your baby…. the value :slightly_smiling_face:
Okay :slightly_smiling_face:
haha! I see my data in there…. awesome! Thanks
/giphy it’s alive!
<!here|@here> Were we doing scrum over slack or a call?
Jumping on now
Okay cool. So on their PSD design, they have some red text that says something similar …. I’d love to know if you’re chatting with them if that was supposed to be the error state or if that supposed to show when the user hits the page the first time as sort of explanatory copy
Yes… do we also need a “Terms and Conditions"
Sure - that copy goes on the main page?
I’ve been pulled on other projects that got a bit unexpectedly hairy… so I’ve not a ton more to report today… I’ll be working on integrating those designs and finishing up the routes today
That new PSD AgeGate above answers all my questions about the error states… thanks
I’m good… couple of questions of where to go with this code-wise… but  is going to show me some stuff today… so hopefully after today I’ll be ready to submit this and have  or someone review it
Actually… I take back what I said about having everything… Just looking at the fonts used in this design… and it looks like I need Gotham (<http://www.typography.com/fonts/gotham/styles/gothambundle>) … not sure if we have an account with these people or if Weber would provide this… I’ve not worked w/ Fonts on a Rain project before so I’m not sure how it works
So how do we generally handle expenses/purchases? Do I use my own card and add it in as an expense in Harvest? Do I use a company card?
Okay - I’ll check with some of the other devs here to see if we have an account with the <http://typography.com|typography.com> site so we retain the rights for Rain if we need it for any other reason… otherwise I’ll just expense it
Cool - thanks
sounds good to me - I'll take it from there and let you know if I run into any problems
So I’m just throwing this out there… technically our Age Gate legal disclaimer (as provided above) violates their privacy policy. Specifically, the following two parts under “Use of Information Collected” ```-We collect only the Personal Information necessary to complete the specific transaction that you request.
 - for any other specific business purpose stated at the time you provide your information.``` So…. Technically we can’t gather any piece information without telling them how we’ll use it. So we should amend the legal copy as such…. ```By providing your email``` to say ```By providing your email *and name*``` …. Not sure who/if anyone needs to know that, just… you know … cya :slightly_smiling_face:
Good to know - thanks
I’ve committed yesterday and today to the `dev` branch what I believe represents the completion of the age gate. I’d love your thoughts on the code itself when you have a chance (the `oauth` post may need to be adjusted when you’re ready).
Sounds good - just wanted to leave it for you here :slightly_smiling_face:
Scrum Update: Mark took a look at my code this morning, had a few notes and I've edited it and pushed it back up to Github.  - I'll look to you to let me know if there's anything else that needs to change with the age gate, or if there's anything on the core skill that I can jump in with. Had to run home for something so I'll be working there today, but available on Slack if you need anything or for a google hangouts or something if you want to talk through anything.
FYI: we had already purchased the Gotham font, so I was able to include it from our <http://typography.com|typography.com> account without having to make a purchase. That said, there are probably other questions for you and  regarding how we bill for that font to the client.
yes, but tubbs mentioned that we would still need to bill the client. Not sure if this is a monthly thing, or if we bill a one time fee since the cost per request is so low.
Google Fonts are free... #justsaying
They could set up their own <http://typography.com|typography.com> account and give us access to it if we wanted to do that as well, that way they could handle the billing however they want
That's correct - it's just that the web font we have charges us for traffic... so Rain would be incurring a monthly cost I believe? That's why I'm not sure how tubbs thought that the billing should go.  I can circle back with him if that's easier and then let you know more accurately what he was thinking
If I were the client… and I had an “age gate” screen (that a small number of people saw an even smaller amount of times)… I don’t know that I’d care much for the difference between Gotham and, let’s say, Open Sans (a free Google Font)…. obviously, they need to get what they want… but from a budget allocation sense, using a paid font for 3 lines on the companion app of an edge-case used device would be something I’d avoid.
<http://www.michelobultra.com/> is using the font… I’d bet they have it somehwere
```@font-face {
  font-family: 'Gotham-Book';
src: url('fonts/Gotham/Gotham-Book.eot');
src: url('fonts/Gotham/Gotham-Book.eot?#iefix') format('embedded-opentype'), url('fonts/Gotham/Gotham-Book.woff') format('woff'), url('fonts/Gotham/Gotham-Book.ttf') format('truetype'), url('fonts/Gotham/Gotham-Book.svg#Gotham-Book') format('svg');
}``` is in their CSS…. so I know they have it!
Someone should tell them that they should secure their font resources a bit better… I just downloaded all of them from their site. So…. problem solved?

Scrum Update: Finished the Age Gate yesterday, Working on integrating it into the Core Skill… then I’ll be looking at helping with the responses
Awesome - After I get the age gate integrated I can focus on that
Perhaps ... getting back into it at the moment - should have my work finished up and then I can look at these.
Thanks - I’ll make sure those get added in and then measured :slightly_smiling_face:
I know you’re w/ a client today, but if you’ve got some availability tomorrow morning - let’s run through the age gate integration together. I’ve got 90% of it there, I’m just running into an error with knowing where I’m at in the request cycle between the age gate and the skill. Shouldn’t take more than 30 minutes for you to walk me through it… but probably better that time spent than me spending more time on it today.
Agreed - After that I’ll let you tell me where the best place is to jump in as well… I think I’ve got the flow of the app down well enough to be of some help now :slightly_smiling_face:
I’ve updated the Technical Architecture overview with those analytics updates… any word yet from their IT dept?
The tech arch is up to date as far as I know
If anything does need updating - or decisions get made that change it - I’ll make sure to update it and ping the group here
For standup  are running out of another meeting in a few and will update the board here shortly
Or the meeting got moved until 2pm today… sorry, my bad… didn’t check the calendar

I'm going to be working today on integrating the age gate with the core skill, Mark gave me a tip yesterday on what the error might be so I'll track that down. Hopefully it's finished today, so I can move onto anything else that will be helpful. I'll update as soon as it's done.
I just merged the code into dev
I’ve already pushed out the check when starting the skill - but if you need to disabled it to test… it’s lines 25-26 on skill/index.js ```
if (!functions.VerifyAccountLinked(this))
this.emit(':tellWithLinkAccountCard', responses.Errors.UserNotAuthorized.tell);```
I’m going to spend a little time looking at them today. Another project came up this morning, but I should be able to look into it in a couple hours
Is there a default username for the EC2 instances?
Thanks - was just running into an error trying to SSH in and wanted to double check everything
I get `Permission denied (publickey).` when I run ```ssh -i "aws-ultra95-jasonDev.pem" <mailto:ubuntu@ec2-107-21-9-145.compute-1.amazonaws.com|ubuntu@ec2-107-21-9-145.compute-1.amazonaws.com>```
The public IP
Yeah - I get `permission denied (public key)`
I created that keyPair on the instance, added it to my ssh and made sure the permission on the file were set.
I thought so? :slightly_smiling_face:
Sorry - I mean I added it on my local machine
Ah… I thought that’s what the Create Key Pair did…. I didn’t see a way to access the aws-ultra95.pem - could you send it to me?
/giphy lockbox
Now I know … you’ll have to change your hiding spot… sock drawer?
I’m in now with that key - thanks!
Anyone else able to see that <https://ultra95-dev.rain.agency> is up? It’s working for 1.5 of us :slightly_smiling_face:
Just accepted mine
I’m going to be updating the font-faces (that was a to-do list item that accidentally dropped off my plate) … but as far as I know we’ve got a working dev server and the age gate/account linking stuff is up. I’ll let  correct me if there’s something more pressing but I was going to next play around with some SSML tags to give her workout prompts (when we get the scripts) a bit of enthusiasm :slightly_smiling_face:
I’m assuming we don’t have scripts yet? Mark is out today, I’ll be putting up a slight update to the fonts today, but otherwise there’s not much progress we can make without those scripts, if any.
I’ll be out of office next week for another client so I’ll be available, but less so and not nearly as responsive… I’ll plan on getting with Mark when he gets back in to see how I can be most helpful on the core skill
/giphy holding my breathe
So what’s the actual deadline for the project as a whole - like when it’s supposed to hit Amazon again?
Perfect - just wanted to make sure to manage expectations - especially for Mark's time
Okay - we'Il be ready when they come
Not much to report on the dev side w/o scripts ... I don't think











yup

with the cards - they load HTML (right?) so should we put the text into the responses.js file?
Makes sense :slightly_smiling_face: Yes if you could email me the list of images that need to be edited, that'd be create.
Thanks
Not going to be available for the dev scrum ... but I'Il be working to have the recipe cards built by EOD thur

So .... my son may have to go into emergency surgery today... he has an eye injury last week that may have worsened.... I just left the office to head home so my wife can take him on... I'll know more in a few hours but if he does have to have surgery I won't be able to work on the project here for a couple days. I'll follow up when I know more.
This may be basic ... but does Alexa support "repeat after me" ... like if you just ask your device to say something?

I'm working on them today ... I didn't have a chance to get to it friday.
The approach I was planning to take on adding the cards was to add a card object/variable at the top of the responses.js file (or require a template file, more like) ... and then use the ```
card: cards.exampleWorkoutCard``` type to insert the given card with the workout ... that scan with you?
that's what I was thinking.
<!here|@here> ... "Pushup" vs "Push Up" vs "Push-Up" .... any thoughts?
lol - that was my dilemma
Google shows "push-up" ... our workouts say "Pushup" and I see it online w/ google also as "Push Up"
I think it's accepted as all three
Okay - I'Il go with what's in the script then... just didn't want to make a mistake that was obv
Do you know if we're planning to host the images from within the age gate url or from some michelob site/CDN?
Okay :slightly_smiling_face:
Thanks
Did we decide on a final URL for the age gate. I have it in the code as a variable so it can change easily... but if we have something already I can put it in
Awesome - thanks.
We may need to review what workouts we have vs what pics we have .... after adding in the html card JS... here's what I've found: ```Workouts without pictures:
Spider Lunges With Rotation
Flow Sequence
Warrior II
Warrior III
Boat
Resolved Chair


Pictures without workouts:
WeaveStep
Burpies
Froggers```
Is `<https://s3.amazonaws.com/ultra95alexasounds/>` an S3 bucket we have for the app's audio resources?
Also ... We've got a "Fat Loss Isometric Squat Jump Ladder" listed in response.js and "Levitating Lunge" listed in a google doc as the 4th Fat Loss workout ... not sure which to use. Levitating Lunge has an image, Isometric Squat Jump Ladder does not.
This is what I'm working thru: <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eJJQ6Dwbxjzz0vkwTmdtv50_nDHFRkykvU74xY1KlIw/edit#gid=0>
The differences I've found have been from that to the code in response.js and the resources assets
Thanks - I'Il look thru that one
Am I reading this right: ```
Instructions for Levitating Lunge
Isometric Squat Jump Ladder Instructions:
``` So that they are the same thing?
Also - feel free to point me in the right direction if there's someone here who would own that question a bit better ... but from the Google Doc you posted above it's not clear to me what's what :slightly_smiling_face:
Here's a PR that represents the work of adding the cards to their own JS file, and linking that in the responses JS ... if you could check over this when you get a chance, that'd be awesome. <https://github.com/mediarain/ultra95-skill/pull/18>
And each card can only have 1 image
So we'Il have to have them combined
Still needing "category descriptions" ... not sure if this is meant for the 3 workout categories, or the workouts themselves, but all we have now are the exercise instructions
As far as I know (apart from card images/text I'm waiting on) ... I'm done with the work I had in Pivotal w/in the skill. Is there anything I can help with or that you need me to look at?
Sweet :slightly_smiling_face:
That should be right -  do weneed to check the env vars in the json file?
config.server.domain
No - I didn't set it in those .... I thought that happened on build
That's right ... sorry about that
I think I just saw that you committed that already, no?
Cool deal - thanks
<https://hangouts.google.com/hangouts/_/mediarain.com/megk>
just opened it up to those w/ link
If it's agreeable with everyone <!here|@here> ... I had some placeholder tasks in pivotal for detailed documentation &amp; unit testing .... given the timeline (and that we're still trying to flesh out how those look at RAIN in general) I'm planning to scrap those for this project ... unless I hear some objections
nothing - was going to add the descriptions in when we get them - but nothing atm
Do you recall if it was whitelisted on the server side - or an Amazon's side?
I can
I don't know if we can ... the examples don't give HTML as an option but I didn't see if it allowed it
Since you said to use the script as the final source that was why I went with the non-bulleted ones
So I'd still have to use HTML to do those breaks ... I'Il add it in and see if the card will allow it, just haven't tried it yet :slightly_smiling_face:
If we can do breaks... we maybe could do bullets then. Would the priority be (1) bullets (2) breaks (3) nothing ?
So line breaks with a dash at the front to create sort of pseudo-bullets?
Okay - I probably won't have time to make that change until this afternoon - but I will take care of it



Thanks :wink:
I set mine up a while ago :slightly_smiling_face:
My apologies ... there was a typo that I didn't catch. I just pushed the fix
When you're available - can we spin up the production EC2 instance for this skill?
I don't see any reason why not - do you  ?
Awesome ... I will start playing with it in a few minutes
Sorry - that would be me .... I changed the invocation name to "ultra ninety five qa" ... so we could use "ultra ninety five" on prod.. if that helps you get up/running w/ QA cool, if not UAT should be configured this morning
Just to check that I'm on the same page as those of you who have done this before... but `54.91.97.20` is the public IP of the prod EC2 instance which should build off of the master/repo of the ultra skill and where I should point the authorization requests, correct?
<http://calorieworkoutskill.com|calorieworkoutskill.com> ?
Yes
This is the screen I'm looking at in the skill setup, but I'm thinking that needs to point somewhere else so I can test the skill, just not sure where
I don't know... it's listed in the technical architecture document as the domain we're using ... but I don't know if the client has approved it
Either way - I'm sure for UAT that'Il have to change to where we have it setup at the moment.. just not sure where that is
<https://ultra95-dev.rain.agency>
Sweet - that's what I was unsure of ... so we'Il have the skill point there
I can take care of inputting the category descriptions today... let's let  focus on the other bugs he's already working on ... ( feel free to let me know if there's any place you need me to jump in)
What are your thoughts on removing "[Invoke]: User cannot enable skill through voice command." from the bug list? Maybe put it in the icebox? This functionality won't be present until launch
Those category descriptions that they sent over include voice/card text .... when I ask what a category is, we already have a response that Alexa says .... which one should I use?
Cool - thanks
Are you ready to merge those changes you put into dev into master? I've got a branch and am wondering if I should make the PR into master or into dev
Correct
^^


































































I was going to add to that description "mainly about how awesome PHP is"... but I thought that might hurt feelings
