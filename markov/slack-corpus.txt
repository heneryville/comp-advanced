Nothing right now
Still working on Social dental
the new practice/dentist profile page
BTW
Yuliya said I should divide my team 50%
The project is to make it actually ECHO everything you say to it
:simple_smile:
I'm looking for the sql in the campbells repo
is there one?
or should I clean install?
ok
I'm almost done with the errors
I think
:simple_smile:
what scripts?
I haven't sent anything
to your branches
or are you looking at my branch?
otherwise, I assume Daniel changed the &lt;scripts&gt; to wp_enqueue in the functions.php
because the codesniffer complains about that
I just merged the staging branch into mine
and once again, almost done with the errors
:smile:
<!channel>: are we not using version control for the plugins?
I see `the_field()` is not instlaled
but its used in page.php
ok
do we have a plugins list in use somewhere?
* active plugins list
we are installing ALL those plugins?
Ok, but wouldn't it be sane to have a list of what plugins are installed in the staging? Or should I just go to staging... and check /wp-admin ?
ok
so I'll just install everything in there
and I'll add wp-content/plugins to the ignore while I'm at it
nope
but I just did
Yeah, it makes sense then to just install them all, otherwise we could get errors when downloading staging if someone used them
You have some reading to do :simple_smile:
NOOO
build failed
" Build finished. No test results found."
what does that mean&gt;?
/giphy woop !
so there are 6 warnings in my pull request
caused by .js files being minified
I'm telling  to make jenkins ignore warnings
is that ok?
on my pull request, it is
(y)
there you go :simple_smile:
/giphy I know
I di
d
so you updated the staging?
ok
I'll merge staging then
¬¬
is there a giphy for that?
no
:disappointed:
nope
please hold
and merge my branch next when I'm done
:smile:
haha
fo sho
that's how they say it?
:disappointed:
Just when I had a good excuse to miss the class
2tyler
ready to merge
/giphy hyperventilate
that's hyperventilate?
really?
HAHAHA
don't you love those successful builds?
/giphy popcorn
haha
only because the dog is funny
stole it from me
:’(
can we get tasks assigned so we can hit them over the weekend?


is anyone else having menu items moving and getting weird on the wp-admin ?
and I see that
wiii
I’m dealing with some myself
I can fix those if you want Steven
^^
:smile:
That sounds good
Got it
Thanks!
Ok, I’ll check when I’m done with the jenkins errors
are you working on that `move-css` branch?
ok, so I’ll work on the chat system branhc
:smile:
Got it
this was a productive night
are the API credentials for the product locator the same from the fresh brewed soups?
Ok
I’ve had to modify the store locator plugin to make it work
How should we handle that?
it’s own repository?
Tell them to not updated it
Etc
I’m working on the product locator. I worked with Daniel on the slides yesterday to integrate them with the parent/base theme from campbells.
not for now
/giphy woop woop
It looks like I don’t have access to the development documents?
In cloud
*the
thanks
I can, but manually
The link doesn’t work
takes me to the home page
That’s why I thought I didn’t have access
I just got an invite to <https://percy.io/>
Let me know if you would like to use it in this project?
it’s continuous integration for frontend, it detects changes and marks them
and someone has to approve them so github can mark the pull request as correct
are you guys running ./check.sh before commiting?
jajajaja
you should
there are some npm modules you install
~3
but then you don’t have to jenkins just to find out
yeah, but they have SSD's
so you have to ask it nicely?
no please no work?
ok
Are we going to add a humans.txt on this project? :)
wheeeee
not me
Ok
I found now that the live chat doesn’t really pass the data from our first form (the one on the design)
// nevermind
I found a way

When is the client review?
So we can go ahead and merge new stuff to staging, right?
great
can you please check and merge?
<https://github.com/mediarain/campbells/pull/80>
thanks!

No, not yet, but I will today then
- Allow it to use search function, and shortcode with moa id (you could only use search with the way it was set up)
- Changed markeup
- Modified the less/css so the loaded bootstrap library only affects the locator content
- Modified the way and order it loads the javascript, and excluded jquery from it
That’s why I loaded the plugin inside the theme
like we did in fresh brewed soups
the “allow moa id in shortcode, and also overall search functionality”, maybe, the rest is customization for the specific site
also, AFAIK, that plugin is delivered to them by the search provider, right?
yes, there is definitely room for improvement
pretty much anywhere
:simple_smile:
is anyone else having issue with the menu in the /wp-admin ?
it happened before
Ok
sounds easy :_
:simple_smile:
ys?
yes*
It should be possible
I think it is without much issue
looking at the `register_taxonomy()`
the only plugin with changes is the store locator
there is code on the plugin that tries to get credentials and url from the settings
but I haven’t found the settings page yet
<!channel> is anyone else having this issue?
I know Daniel has it
let me check
no, it’s not the menu filter
I’ll update my local env to 4.3.1
nope
still happening in 4.3.1
I’ll switch themes
it’s not that either
the menu
WP menu
really?
OK
`add_action('admin_enqueue_scripts', 'chrome_fix');
function chrome_fix() {
	if ( strpos( $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'], 'Chrome' ) !== false )
		wp_add_inline_style( 'wp-admin', '#adminmenu { transform: translateZ(0); }' );
}`
in the functions.php
is supposed to fix it
yup
my bad
:smile:
should we implement that?
I had an issue with  chrome once, it took them two months to fix whatever was causing the issue with my app :simple_smile:
it annoys me greatly
it probably will annoy the client too :simple_smile:
why was the `Template` tag removed from the style head?
:smile:
gulp doesn’t seem to be writing the style.css
did anybody play with it?
yes
that broke something
fixing it
no, it’s not in the gulpfile anymore
it was saved with the merge conflict
:simple_smile:
<https://github.com/mediarain/campbells/blob/staging/wp-content/themes/campbells/style.css#L2>
wordpress still reads it
for theme handling
it’s fixed now
I think  intention was to leave the style.css static
so I did that
just left the style.css with the theme info
ok
wow
/giphy delivery
I have lost my faith on giphy
/giphy flood
no
Wordpress reads it
it shouldn’t require much changing
it only contains

yes
I’m doing that right now
ok
so I’ll delete it now
yep
NOOOO
best gif ever
so alive
:disappointed:
Did I accept it ?
I meant to say the change was done
It means that it's finished. That you can test it. However. The chat won't work because is set with test environment.
But you should be able to click it. Get a form. Etc
No. It should open a different window
Not a modal in the same window
No :disappointed:

can you please check? <https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-campbells-hub-theme/pull/3>
yeah, it should be turned off in prod
they won’t be turning wp_debug off?
I think it’s the core
but I’ll take a look right now
so yeah
it’s totally our code :stuck_out_tongue:
<https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-campbells-hub-theme/pull/26>
there we go
you can pull latest into CSC
ok
checking
whoop whoop
I have
all the grid stuff: integration with backend, ajax load, and filter
Yes they are
yes
`product_categories` and `brand_categories`
ah, no
I can upload that
oh ok
there you go :simple_smile:
He;s not around. But I think he said something about the Recipe not being for 1.0 release, then Recipe Link was faster/easier to implement

any luck with the permalinks? I know Daniel has been trying for long
cool
that’s definitely the name for permalink debugging
rabbit hole
:smile:

HAHA
<http://makeit.netflix.com/the-switch>
The drag&amp;drop bug in the slides is caused by piklist
I never saw it because I sticked to the version on the repository
I updated it now to match the staging version and got the bug
Is there any reason to have it updated?
Its a dependency for the slides on the base theme
It’s used for custom fields
I think we should stick to the version on the repository
Ok
I’ll dowgrade it then
ok, drag&amp;drop works now
Both the FAQ plugin and the newsletter plugin require API credentials
same API fields
url, user and password
FAQ API Link	
FAQ Kb ID	
FAQ Topic Key
Wt.chat.PublicChat.crsChatSystem = 'testcampbellchat';
no
no
only the last 3
I thought they were the same
are we allowed to modify the plugins further?
I.e: There isn’t a function to retrieve all mail lists
but there is an endpoint for that
and from the copy deck, there are 9 mail lists
so I guess it would be a good idea to use it
Ok
<http://campbellscom.staging.wpengine.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1263&amp;action=edit> doesn’t have an image
also:
<http://campbellscom.staging.wpengine.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1262&amp;action=edit>
<http://campbellscom.staging.wpengine.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1260&amp;action=edit>
Ok
yeah
I’ve been entering brand and categories for all chunky products I could find
zenks
what do you mean?
<http://campbellscom.staging.wpengine.com/campbell-soup/chunky/>
ah ok
no problemo
the where to buy for the grid
for the products grid
yeah
brand grid
I still have to integrate the locator to the brands grid, but that is a separate story
Yes I did
Thankd
S
That plugin only brings a js to make api calls
I'm trying to make the brands work with the store locator. (Preselected brand when coming from a brand page )
I won't be committing anything tonight
/giphy UUH
/giphy kickass
/giphy YEAHH!
I don’t see my changes on /wp-admin =/
whut
:smile:
Cool :)
/giphy FAIL!
scrum ?
yes
it was great
I can’t believe you missed it
there were clowns
monkeys
baloons
the real deal!
one had a space suit


yes
I am
yeah
just name the text input to “s"
and have the form GET to “/"

/giphy fail
I like that fail
lol
/giphy tyler
I think giphy doesn’t like you
/giphy doesn’t like you
/giphy nobody
I’m here
on theme settings
there is a newsletter section
it loads a repeater field
with all the existing mail lists from the API
so you can enter the correct copy to each one
cool
its shows them first
on the brand grid
on the “featured” category
ok, products grid
inside the brand
it uses the brand field
inside the product
(checking)
is that on product post type?
ok
it’s text after the product name
in the product-single
yes
Ok
Ah, ok
I assume they come with piklist instead of ACF
Ok
I can work on that now
Just let me go get a coffee
~5 minutes
soy espalda
Ok
do you have the text domain to load the translation?
Ok
I think so
let me merge that in
did that nutrition-facts page work for you?
I’m not getting “translated” results
are we setting wp_lang anywhere in wp-config?
got it working
^^
when are we getting the data for the products from the api?
Ok
But we are presenting to the client on monday, right?
Is it a good idea to do that before monday?
Yes, but if we break the product/brand relation, some navigation (breadcrumbs at least) won’t work
so yeah, tuesday is better


can’t the script update instead of replacing everything? you could look up the product first with the MOA id
checking
<http://campbellscom.staging.wpengine.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1772&amp;action=edit>
<http://campbellscom.staging.wpengine.com/product/25-less-sodium-chicken-noodle-soup/>
it’s already using the featured image
but there are some products without image
Yeah, I’m fixing that
:smile: :smile: :smile:

HAHAHA
lol
kind of
I'm at the supermarket
Should be back in around 30 minutes
What do you need?
I’m here
hi
I see
so we will relate brands to those categories?
Nothing yet on the brand name field. I have only worked on the custom categories for the products grid
Do you want me to build something quick for that?
?
Ok
Sounds good
yes we are
Search only
Yes I did
I'll work on it
I downgraded the piklist plugin
To the version in the repository
Did someone update it?
Ok
should know
omg
“gracias prix"
try <http://matt.thiessen.us/custom-post-type-redirects-to-404-page/>
?
<http://campbellscom.staging.wpengine.com/where-to-buy/#brand/p73549>
there’s no category with id p73549
<http://campbellscom.staging.wpengine.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=124&amp;action=edit>
yes
!-- Request: our-soups --&gt;

!-- Matched Rewrite Query: name=our-soups&amp;amp;page= --&gt;
!-- Loaded Template: single.php --&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
can’t we just set a redirect?
redirect  <http://campbellscom.staging.wpengine.com/our-soups/> to the right url
with the redirect api
*plugin
that’s great bingo
that regex doesn’t seem to match the request
:smile:
none of them work
check: <http://campbellscom.staging.wpengine.com/pace/>
I don’t think so
Pong
?
Hi
yes
Ok
makes sense
its either that or having separate fields
it’s “easier” because then I don’t have to parse the input to check if it’s an URL
yep
ok
I’ll shoot that now
shouldn’t it be backwards?
use alt if there’s no title?
/giphy life thug
so it’s only Tyler who can’t be thug
we can add an exclude
field
"Exclude brands” field
you choose that on the slide
what is bleepin bloop the blops?
sounds like fruit loops
oh ok
makes sense
wth
Ok
oh
sounds good
ok
Ok
Taking a look now
BTW, did they merge in my changes to the user api plugin?
ok
Import seems to work on my local env.
But I don’t think we’ll be able to use
the taxonomy  mentioned
yes, it would
we can add a check
If (class_exists(‘theemailpluginclass’)) ) ) ) ) )
else
NOTHIGN
/giphy nothing
I’d like to let  do all the work while I just watch his screen
if that’s ok
I think  is mostly done with the styling for the email, and checking the multiple submits shouldn’t be a big issue
as for the products
I think I’ll have the products and brands correctly linked tomorrow morning
Ok
I like the first thanks :simple_smile:
/giphy yaaaaaaay
<http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/local/story/2015/oct/15/chattanooga-becomes-first-10-gigabit-city-world/330691/>
can we all move there?
ok
I just noticed we may need a “sub category wilke ID"
*will
lots of the brands are under the “Campbells soup” wilke category
so right now I can only direct them there
I think I’m done. can you please check them?
on the brands grid
click on where to buy
it should send you to the correct category
on store locator
ok, that is expected
WHY daniel?
/giphy Y?
done
all brands have no parent now in the devcsc
is that supposed to be that way?
yeah, Steven will import the brands again, right?
that should fix it
<https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-campbells-hub-theme/pull/236>
^^
the build is hanging
/giphy yeah


yay
ooooops
I just merged my own PR
and it failed
wow
<https://builds.mediarain.com:8443/job/Campbells-Dot-Com-PR/634/console>
what doest that mean? : )
yup
I went crazy!
<!channel>: is anyone specifically responsible for content in the WP?
there are a lot of "Featured flavors are not being pulled in” bugs in the google doc
and that’s just because the associated products are not published
they are still drafts
what?
ooh ok
kewl
how do I get a copy of the DB on devcsc?
hey there
I saw it
Is the base url ALWAYS the same?
I’m fixing the brand name im products callouts
yes
but for some reason
<http://devcsc.wpengine.com/campbells/campbell-soup/slow-kettle/>
says “campbells"
but on my local version says "SLOW KETTLE® STYLE SOUPS"
that’s why I was asking for a copy of the devcsc DB
I’ll work on the  FAQ now
<http://devcsc.wpengine.com/campbells/campbell-soup/slow-kettle/> has it wrong
but it’s right on <http://devcsc.wpengine.com/campbells/product/fiesta-chicken-lime-tortilla-soup-with-white-meat-chicken/>
Yes
I manually checked
they have the correct brand
that’s why it shows it correctly on the product single view
but for some reason, not in the products call out
and I only see it on devcsc
I’ll work on the FAQ
There’s no way of getting a copy of the db? the import tool doesn’t override existing posts
yay
can you please merge to CSC ?
my FAQ commit seems to be lost
on the staging
because it works perfectly locally
how?
<http://devcsc.wpengine.com/campbells/connect/faq/>
I’ve reimported many times the FAQ
and it’s still showing incorrect links
something is wrong
that change should be in staging too
but I’m looking at the file via SFTP and it’s not there
Ok
looking at it
ok
please let me know when changes are on CSC
so I can check the FAQ
wheee
what product?
!!
:stuck_out_tongue:
why won’t you let me merge your PR? :disappointed:
Taking a look
Ok
No. I can modify the query to get only published products
OK, I guess I don’t like reading.
Daniel and I are working on it
tha’ts very you, daniel
:simple_smile:
we think we are done with #4
can another pair of eyes double check for us?
reminds me a bit of Fez from that 70’s show
so once we are done publishing all products
we go and delete old drafts
right?
*all drafts
(they sound the same in my head :stuck_out_tongue: )
yes
yay
are the migration jobs to set to run themeselves?
no they are not
everyone?
:simple_smile:
^^
/giphy GOODBYE!
/giphy so long farewell
/giphy dancing
is coming next week?
I’m looking at the filters thing
I think it’s best now if I remove the default “featured” filter on the products grid
and just add a “Featured” category
for the products
that then can be used in the filters
does that sound good  ?
yes
yes, you can do that
I’ve already added the category on devcsc
oh, I see
I’m workign on it
ok
:disappointed:
Sorry for my late responses, gmail is taking minutes to send an email, and then I have 5 new in the inbox
I don’t think so, they will be done on production, right?
wohoo
I asked once but forgot to annoy with it
a humans.txt would have been great :stuck_out_tongue:
That sounds very tricky
let me try locally
Ok
ok
any more info on this?
Ok
I have it working. But the code sniffer complains about me using $_SESSION
so I have two options:
1- make CS shut up
2- use something like <https://github.com/ericmann/wp-session-manager>
^^
ok
:smile:
<https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-campbells-hub-theme/pull/273>
I can include $wp_session class now
yes
Ok
makes sense
Daniel and I pretty much finished the new permalink for the products
I’ll work on that now
ok
that should be plenty
<https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-campbells-hub-theme/pull/274>
yes
it is still necessary
even with array_map and using a sanitizing fuction
*function
the code sniffer would mark it as a violation
register/login
/giphy solid gold
it’s so bad it’s good?
we found an issue with the permalinks
it would be perfect if all started with /campbell-soup
but I forgot about spaghettios
and that breaks it
:simple_smile:
*IF* I get it to work :stuck_out_tongue:
I’m starting to think that it may not be possible
my rewrite rules:
$new_rules['campbell-soup/(.+?)/(.+?)/?$'] = 'index.php?product=$matches[2]';
$new_rules['(.+?)/(.+?)/?$'] = 'index.php?product=$matches[2]';
see the result:
WP only tries the first matched rule
it’s not cache
the nonce is changing on each page load
6872556e0e
9b2d9f14fb
yes
it’s like they are not published?
but they are
no
<http://campbellsoupco.wpengine.com/campbells/bolthouse-farms/>
not only that
<http://campbellsoupco.wpengine.com/campbells/campbell-soup/chunky/>
ALSO
<http://campbellsoupco.wpengine.com/campbells/wp-admin/post.php?post=223&amp;action=edit>
it has V8 CCNW product lines assigned
not chunky ones
they are right in <http://campbellscom.staging.wpengine.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=223&amp;action=edit>
<http://devcsc.wpengine.com/campbells/our-brands/>
yes
<http://devcsc.wpengine.com/campbells/campbell-soup/chunky/>
yes
something went very wrong on data import
<http://campbellsoupco.wpengine.com/campbells/wp-admin/post.php?post=223&amp;action=edit>
it has for some reason, V8 CCNW product lines assigned
in the brand info, and products slide
<http://campbellsoupco.wpengine.com/campbells/our-brands/> filter works now
<http://campbellsoupco.wpengine.com/campbells/campbell-soup/chunky/> doesn’t work yet
that’s because
it’s a draft
and you’re not logged in
<http://campbellscom.staging.wpengine.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=2585&amp;action=edit>
there’s no reason for the MOA’s to be different
one sec
<http://campbellscom.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/themes/campbells/css/live-chat.css>
<http://devcsc.wpengine.com/campbells/wp-content/themes/campbells/css/live-chat.css>
but there is a 500 error
ah ok
let me check
cssUrl = window.location.protocol + '//' + window.location.hostname + '/wp-content/themes/campbells/css/live-chat.css';
so yes
it assumed campbells
scripts/templates/connect.js
no problemo
click
no
just no products returned
{"spot_location_id":null,"api_data":{"max_stores":10,"msg_always":"","image":"","site_id":0,"radius":"30","message":"","city":"Commerce","zip":"90022","search_key":"","state":"CA","site_title":"","msg_instead_of_search":"","msg_results":"","full_description":"","desc":"","customer":"campbellsweb","recommended_items":"","lastDistance":0,"itemDesc":"","numStoresFound":0,"msg_no_results":"","dropdown_description":"","distanceUnit":"mi","found":false,"nearbyStores":[]}}
I see the main store locator
uses spot-location-id
and that’s how it finds them
but we don’t get that from the API
do we?
I don’t think so
I didn’t see anything like that
but I can double check
on the main locator?
or the producto ne?
*one
locator in product:
action:store_locator_request
param:&amp;siteitemid=&amp;zip=90022&amp;radius=100
spot_api_location_id:
product_moa_id:280000016777
ok
The product I constantly used to test the locator was <http://campbellscom.staging.wpengine.com/product/organic-tortilla-soup/> . Which now doesn’t work. I tried re-importing an old snapshot of the database to my local env to check, and it doesn’t work either. The MOA id is the same: 280580076154. Could it be something with the locator API?
according to <https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/1409524/stories/104670122>
it was last working on october 1st
so I’ll go back in git to that date
and test
old database, commit 9235eb81f6f3d9b9249b4e38da955827b6668f50 . Still not working
Ok
yes, but I can’t find anything wrong =/
no
it just sends the MOA to the api
no stores found

I’ll wait for the import to finish

YAY!
This is funny. It’s not the content of the post. If I go to /wp-admin and edit the content there, it’s set to empty again on save. :smile:
and it happens with all faqs. interesting
found the issue
the WDS import plugin is adding somewhere a filter
and that filter, for some reason, is cleaning my post_content
but I fixed the issue now
I’ll push soon
I thought I fixed it, still trying to work around that filter
<https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-campbells-hub-theme/pull/280>
yeah
not on the bottom of the title field
BUT
there is a separate slug field
if you go to screen options and activate it
: )
yes, it would complain about me using $wpdb to insert the posts


so the Drive guy thinks I’m awesome?
<http://www.campbells.com/> works great
the other one still points to the old site
let me clear my dns
(as if that ever really worked in os x)
haha
never ending too

is somebody actually working on them?
I assume this is top priority? because I was looking at social dental stuff
?
ok

HAHA
that’s worth AT LEAST a cup of coffee
WORK DANIEL!
B-)
: )
I’m never bored
done
ok
/giphy I feel pretty
thanks for nothing giphy



lol






yup?
yeah
Yes, but one more change was requested
I’ll do that today
you are guelcom
why did it fail?
:simple_smile:
?
^^^ is that the devsc? I still don’t see my changes
<http://devcsc.wpengine.com/campbells/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=email_us_settings>
nope
and it just failed
let me check
it worked
I accidentally merged before build finished
:simple_smile:
<!channel>: how do we trigger a new build?
yay?
no andrés and no nathan


Yes?
Uhm.  Not really.  Never needed.
I'll play with it then

Campbell's

I will
I can work on that today
no you can't
my throat hurts
uuuh
soup
I would love that
to which Daniel should have replied: just hanging out, keeping it real
they are :smile:
I guess
/giphy UUUH
wrong uuh
so I think I have the changes needed for the video and newsletter slides
I think Matt will css them?
?
<https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-master-parent-theme/pull/1>
we don’t have *right now* a server to deploy anything for the parent theme, but can you make the check.sh run on commits?
Cool, thanks!
Yes, I did, but I will make the same changes on the campbell’s theme. So we can get it out quickly
Matt: <https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/#inbox/1523bbfa9c05dc93>
those are the changes I did
We got one last night
This is weird
I just cloned the hub theme repository
ran ./check.sh
and I’m getting a bunch of errors
yippie yay!
has there been any changes on the codesniffer rules?
oh ok
I’ll just fix them
there is somethign wrong with the codesniffer
see:
FILE: ...ain/pfw-wp-campbells-hub-theme/scripts/slides/newsletter-form.js
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Yep
Yep
What do you mean one page?
That's the example of the reported errors in one file
Ok. I'll continue checking what's wrong with the code sniffer
url?
did you look at the errors?
please do
can you send it to all campbells-dev?
I might need it too :simple_smile:
zenks
so the codesniffer errors are only for new clones
?
otherwise that PR would have triggered errors too
sweet
let me look at the share links
please check the share buttons
yes
<http://campbellscom.staging.wpengine.com/campaign-chunky/>
and a newsletter slide
?
quickly, and it could be done now, that I’m adding other fields
de naiden
yep
can someone give me the autoplay attribtue?
is it “autoplay"?
ok
but The link is to the youtube video, not to the page
ys
*yes
Yep, that’s what I mentioned in the email
yes
I am
Yeah
for the autoplay, the container div grows with the image, if there’s none, the container has no height
can you take care of that?
<https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-campbells-hub-theme/commit/085b1376155e99bbab6e57c81c2873d49c91b379>
think while you do :smile:
you can alternate :smile:
so *I* have to fix it? :’(
yes I can
ok
will do
I did autoplay
too late
/giphy too late!
there you go: <https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-campbells-hub-theme/commit/e4556c45b68e776889da7e96f543875cdd35c4ad>
Ok
Ok
I’m checking those
<https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-campbells-hub-theme/pull/328>
are you currently editing the campaign page?
or did you just leave it open?
ok
no
not ready
now they want to share the page url
so I have to work on the og meta tags
^^
ok
ok, it may not need any more coding, we can set the og tags from the plugin, as Steven said
I did check
And I did see the tags
nope
not right now
sorry I left it open
I closed it now
I will
we don’t have a /chunky/ page to be the parent of this one
not yet
I’m creating the page
are you editing right now?
ok
Yes
The page is done
but it’s not under any page
<http://devcsc.wpengine.com/campbells/wp-admin/post.php?post=21599&amp;action=edit>
and yes, we would need to create a chunky page
and serve the content from there, and not the brand
should I do that?
^^
Ok
will do
Yep
definitely
ag, I created the chunky page
but now we have a 404 for the mom pride
<http://devcsc.wpengine.com/campbells/campbell-soup/chunky/mompride/>
so it looks like we were wrong
brands have preference
ok, is there any new content?
latest were the button links
and I did that last night
not from me
ok
done
But the rewrite rule doesn’t seem to be there: <http://campbellsoupco.wpengine.com/campbells/campbell-soup/chunky/mompride/>
yay!
no idea
do you have outlook?
<https://community.adxstudio.com/blogs/shan/2012-12-17-win8-tip-setting-outlook-default-mail-client/>

can you please make the staging branch the default? currently it’s set on “latest"
cool
thanks
:simple_smile:

yes
I did now
working on the regex right now
but
I do have a question
Must contain at least 2 of the following: (upper case alpha, lower case alpha, numeric

characters, special characters).
does it mean, that it needs 2 of each?
or two of any?
ok
good
because otherwise it’s crazy
not yet
but will this afternoon
when I’m done with this
does that look ok?
^^^
or
?
there is one
on top
but I guess it doesn’t get much attention?
^^
lol
too late
it’s on staging now
:smile:



Yeah
I'll get on the Computer when we stop somewhere
yes?
wait
giphy got it right
something must be wrong
REALLY wrong
ok
let me remember it
peachepe
you missed it
:simple_smile:
I plan to be finishing it tomorrow morning
I hope
:smile:
I’m on it
lol
olakease
ag
^^
good luck!
everything on the current site
unless we are making campbell-soup a completely separate site
Ok
Let me think about it
Brands could be pages, with a “Brand” checkbox
uhm


Actually, we are planning to meet in a bit
to do that
Daniel and I
Regroup after
since we are taking the backend items out of the stories
should we remove the “backend” label from them and add “frontend”?
and reassign them
ok
so should I just edit the stories then? and remove the frontend bits
ok
sounds good
:simple_smile:
/giphy SPAM
was your dad ever bitten by a hamster?
just trying to figure out why it keeps happeningggg
then no idea
/giphy hamster bite
cool
Is somebody not runing check.sh?
and/or just merging stuff without the jenkins check?
<!channel>: ^^
ok ok
nevermind
whooo
good
I’m working on the "try it with” slide
Ok
<!channel> I won't be attending scrum today. I have a personal emergency to attend
guess who’s back
back again
:stuck_out_tongue:
all good now
thanks!
great, now I look bad, THANKS
:stuck_out_tongue:
we could try loading something from youtube, but it’s not optimal
let’s have image required then
why would they upload a video without thumbnail anyways?
therefore we make it required, they can’t add a video without the thumbnail

For the new recipes in <http://campbells.com|campbells.com>, the API doesn’t return any image, what are the plans for that?
ah ok
cool!
^^
wheee
yep
well it depends
maybe she’s late for work
haha
on her first day
I got that cool notification “Yarden OOO"
at midnight
I was like “WHAT SCRUM RIGHT NOW?"
why do you think it’s easier?
but if sauces has pretty much the same styling, why not just use that?
Also, we would need to add functionality from the parent theme to campbells hub each time
so <http://campbells.com|campbells.com> will use the master parent theme?
and then we’ll use a lot of overrides?
for css
I liked the idea of having a blank child theme from which we can start new projects
Based from the campbells hub theme
That’s what I like of “not be in the parent theme?” Colors? Fonts?”, then we have a very clean setup for child themes
we *only* have to add colors and fonts
Then let’s draw the line. What can we expect to be overriden often for frontend?
so are we just not loading the parent theme css at all?
If we don’t use a child theme for campbell’s hub
Yes
Parent theme should keep all core functionality, and templates. And maybe, basic layout css.  Child theme should include colors and fonts, maybe a slide template override if needed.
How would you override the css?
Just not load the parent theme css? Or have 2 css?
but that’s not very efficient
the browser now has to load 2 heavy css files
and one basically just says, “not red, green!"
But it’s easier to have to replace some stuff, some times. Than having to override every color, font, and possibly layout, on each project.
Can we list the not so simple changes needed so far?
so we can choose based on that
Ok, so from my point of view, it’s best if we stick to parent/child. Parent has basic layout css. Child has colors, fonts, etc. Slides templates are easily overridden if needed (you just add the file to the child theme) and don’t impose a performance issue. But having 2 full css files, on which 1 just overrides a lot of the master one, then it is a performance issue for the browser. It has to load them, and then render based on that.
Other option
Because I’m trying to see it from the frontend side
It’s that we do keep a parent theme with ALL css
but for the child theme, we just copy/paste it on to the child theme folder
and we never serve the parent theme css at all
but we would need to be careful on adding back to the parent theme css, new changes needed, from the child theme
does it make sense?
yes
:smile:
yeah
But maybe start by separating our less files?
layout and style
that should help to clean everythign
Daniel has a point
we could concatenate both css for serving
yeah
Even with the current approach
we just don’t serve 2 css files
Yes
YEs
He said yes
while going to the kitchen
haha
yes
Do eet
It’s where you file all your gulps
Like the x-files
but with gulps
instead of x's
it’s more like, favorite gulps
like when you collect pepsi stickers
haha
unless
I was waiting on  to voice his comments :simple_smile:
I should have commented that
now I’m hungry
not as good
as my lunch
let me show you

haha
dulce

can I get wp-admin access for <http://cscrain.staging.wpengine.com|cscrain.staging.wpengine.com>?
the main installation
not to the multisite
^^^
gracielas
/giphy marta
well, I got the plugin to work
we’ll need to submit changes to CSC
I’ll confirm later everything works
I just imported products, and I’m trying recipes now
But I still need to play
so the CCNW product lines get in there
I have to jump with my left feet only
for 3 minutes
then sing something
and finally catch an ant with my eyes
featured images won’t come from there
mentioned that for last campbells websites, they uploaded all the images manually
that’s why I suggested to have Andrés run an import with his super cool script
that does add images
uhmmm
lovely
let me check then
we can try that
let me see how my local import did
no, that didn’t work on my fresh install
so it’s the plugin not setting the featured image
but
how did you import in sauces?
the plugin isn’t even active there
did you wordpress import? or WDS import?
ah
makes sense
nevermind
from <http://campbells.com|campbells.com> ?
Ok
WDS import doesn’t do anything with Wordpress import
WDS import, works directly with the API from csc
Yes, that should work
we’ve been looking at different issues
I was trying to debug the WDS importer
which has nothing to do with WP Import
so yes, we should/could clean everything
and do another WP import
trash as in all files and etc?
Ok
Let’s try that then
Ok, we have products with images and CCNW product lines in now.
And we have recipes
haha
confirming everything is ok?
for /campbells
that’s the one that needs the menus re-set
dulce
We have recipes with images on cscrain/campbells
got it
noticed some slides were renamed
so now their content is gone
who is officially in charge of putting in content?
^^


Sounds good
thanks
first one failed
don't
I’m adding the images
as Steven proposed
<https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-master-parent-theme/pull/51>
gracielas
on it
¬¬
:s
so when are you leaving?
: )

let me reset your pass
what site are you trying to check?
sauces or campbells?
ok
lol
sent
<https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-master-parent-theme/pull/53>
I’m there
<https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-master-parent-theme/pull/54>
NOO
it doesn’t compile
<https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-master-parent-theme/pull/58>
anyone?
haha
done
ajúa
and product grids are working again
in case somebody noticed they were gone
:stuck_out_tongue:
<https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-master-parent-theme/pull/61>
^^
what is github?
:simple_smile:
you’re not a fan
if you haven’t watched better call saul
oh wait
you said “I was"
so you’re not anymore :stuck_out_tongue:
both seasons
they upload new episodes each tuesday I think
amx FTW
is talking to himself today
:stuck_out_tongue:
lol
there’s no giphy for yarden
that sucks
hahaha
could we possibly use git for deployments then?
(jenkins does git push production after all checks are done)
can we remove what is done from the google doc?
kewl
just 2 pages
sweet
shouldn’t we have an unlimited supply of campbell’s soups at the offices?
fixed :stuck_out_tongue:
For exports, the issue seems to be a combination of running out of memory (fixed) and an execution time limit of 60 seconds from wpengine
It _seems_ to be working for now, but if it happens more, we’ll have to see if we move to a dedicated/private server
^^
I talked to their support, they said they can disable the timeout on dedicated
They can’t disable it per-site on the shared hosting
/giphy forever
haha
/giphy master of puppets
ok
/giphy somebody!
we were supposed to do work today?
AH
phew
hahaha
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnXWE_9Lfb0>
hahahahahahahah
that is good team work
I’m just going to say:
quarry strain
yeah
blame auto correct
it was ’s auto correct
oh ok
it’s the FAQs
we fixed that for v8
but never implemented it on <http://campbells.com|campbells.com>
problem is we don’t have individual pages for FAQs
so we’ll just redirect them all to the main FAQs page
makes sense?
we could pass the ID in the quarry strain
and have JS scroll to that specific faq
where?
OH IS A PHONE
ok
sorry
I think so yeah

<https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-brand-parent-theme/pull/79>
No thanks to jenkins
It failed
Haha
ok
it wasn’t jenkins
and it’s something I can fix
:smile:
if you are using the check.sh, make sure to delete your local csc-standards folder before using it next time
<https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-brand-parent-theme/pull/80>
what isn’t working in devcsc?
Susbtr
<http://php.net/substr|php.net/substr>
what?
description truncation?
hah
ok, ingredients are in!
where?
focusing on newsletter and coupons now
failed
`saturated-fat` needs to be “translated"
I think tyler changed the identifier of the language
the ‘campbellparent’ part or whatever
check that
I’m still unable to login to devcsc
yay!
/giphy yay
<http://devcsc.wpengine.com/campbells/> doesn’t have our theme selected
Our style.css are different for some reason
<http://devcsc.wpengine.com/wp-content/themes/pfw-wp-brand-parent-theme/style.css>
or at least
it differs from my local copy
and I just pulled everything
<http://devcsc.wpengine.com/wp-content/themes/pfw-wp-brand-parent-theme/style.css> and <http://cscrain.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/themes/pfw-wp-brand-parent-theme/style.css> are almost the same
but it doesn’t match my local style.css
how does your local style.css look like
?
oh nevermind, I was looking at the wrong folder
/giphy noise
how am I supposed to troubleshoot then?
Ok
Facts are that my local installation works fine, and that devcsc doesn’t. So there is something different, best way to troubleshoot is see what is different
So yeah, step 1 would be to include all the themes that are also on devcsc
what other themes are in devcsc?
they still have the hub theme there too
right?
ok
do you have the errors they were seeing?
do you have the error they were getting on devcsc?
I have:
pfw-wp-brand-parent-theme
pfw-wp-campbells-hub-theme
pfw-wp-campbells-soups-theme
pfw-wp-slides-base
in my local multisite
and I don’t get any errors
that error only appears when there are important files missing
like functions or index.php
can we get them to double check everything is uploaded?
just for the lolz
any word on why we can’t login with okta?
can we at least get an snapshot of their dev?
files and DB
we don’t need the uploads folder, so it’s not huge
yeah, but it’s not working
it’s not a credentials problem
yay
ajúa
Lol
working on the coupons and newsletter
confirmed
user ratings are back on the api
we need to re-sync
:simple_smile:
yes
WHOOHOOOO
/giphy what does the fox say
I'll be traveling all day today
Kewl
we are
login
NOW
How did we import the products at the end?
Yes
I'll do that
what do you mean?
nope, that’s a weird one
refresh
do you have a ton of tabs open?
:smile:
I’m reimporting recipes right now
They need to install it on their wordpress install
<http://cscrain.staging.wpengine.com/campbells/>
ratings are there now
<https://wordpress.org/plugins/add-to-any/>
Send them that link. That’s the plugin they need to install
now
Oh nevermind
I did csc rain
Let me update devcsc
that wasn’t the issue
the devcsc is having the same import timeout issue, and they never got around it
so he had to break the import file into small pieces
and in WP, when you export in pieces (i.e:, by post type), it does not include the media
only the full export includes the media, for some reason
can you please add  to harvest?
he’ll be helping out with the tasks Daniel and I currently have assigned
/giphy NOOOOOO
how do you get in the zone?
I want a burger too :’(
:smile:
It’s no surprise I gained more weight in Utah
haha
those lovely five guys burgers
haha
/giphy oops
:eyes:
good thing of importing from devcsc is that we don’t have the HTTP auth issues
true that
which reminds me, can you add   to wpengine plis?
oh yes, he needs devcsc access too, I’ll add him
nevermind, he needs the okta access
yep, I just sent it to Daniel and Dax
Ok
<https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-brand-parent-theme/pull/103>
do you know why jenkins didn’t check this?
^^
yeah,  is looking at it
thanks
campbells soups, sauces, kitchen cms, and kitchen for now
well, it looks like we can’t export from devcsc
it times out
:smile:
cscrain campbells soups is working again
however, I think all QA will be done on devcsc
devcsc is timing out when trying to export campbells soups. We’ll need to figure out how deal with this when moving everything to their live environment
I think that to use WP CLI, we will still need access to their servers, so maybe our best shot now is using another import/export plugin
I saw one last week that may be of help
Let me find it
No, WP CLI runs on the command line
The export and import use WXR files
so they don’t connect to DB directly
<!channel>: scrum?
You’re in CK scrum right now?
ok, we’ll wait for the utahnians to join
/giphy baby come back
ok no
haha
I dont know
fun and profit?
only 6?
so we have trimmed the list to 3 plugins, I’ll let you know at the end of the day which was is our best option for handling migrations from now on
keeping it real
here’s a fix for the drag&amp;drop bug caused by the piklist and ACF conflict: <https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-plugins/pull/4>
on the old version, it was included in the theme
and then we used the `wp_pagenavi()`
yes, in the search results
As far as I can remember, yes
:smile:
hahahahaha
/giphy the humans are dead
ok
are we updating WP for the new sites? <https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.5>
nope
Ok
so far I have liked <https://deliciousbrains.com/wp-migrate-db-pro/> a lot
it does allow connection between servers
I was trying it last night but my internet is just too slow
so I’ll continue today
^
ok will do
looks like I broke staging
:smile:
oh the joy
no I didn't
it was the mail list api failing
:smile:
oxymoron
and I’m deadpool
hahahaha
I think so
Let me check the mirror
haha
yeah, just finishing the coupons thing
hahaha
hahaha
cats are from hell
they can’t keep it real
at least
godaddy did that
they got caught
they would track domain availability search
and register them themselves
HAHA
haha
so brutal Yarden lags all the time
because it’s just too fast for our router
the whole bar is optimal
I guess
:thumbsup:
yes
we may be using Downey in the future

don’t you love it when your code is fine without running the check.sh locally? :stuck_out_tongue:
/giphy ew
can you please check my PRs?
I want them on staging before I do something
/giphy thumbs up
gracielas
If something needs to be pushed to devcsc at any time, let me know.
^^
oh you having lunch
while I’m starving
haha
Early lunch?
yep
yep
yep
I’ll send you a pic of my lunch
haha
can you elaborate?
weird how?
olakease

QA should be on devcsc now
that’s what the client will be QAing tomorrow

keeping it real
is working on it
looks saucy
HAHAHA

guaro up
^
fo sho
no issue
it’s on csc rain, not devcsc
do you have anything you’d like to push too?
so it goes all at once
ok
it is to me
command + shift + R
always
ALWAYS
why?
who’s that?
:stuck_out_tongue:
I thought it was donald trumph
oh well
re-finishing the newsletter thing
~1 hour
1.5 maybe
ok
kewl
can you wait 15 minutes before devcsc?
I want to push something too
in a bit
cool
almost done
ok I’m ready
I’ll push now
yes, I’m on it
also wait for another commit on the soups repo
<https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-campbells-soups-theme/pull/434> should be the last
noyce
yay!
yep
<https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-brand-parent-theme/pull/143>

ajúa!

yes
<https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-brand-parent-theme/pull/160>
we were there already :stuck_out_tongue:
EVERYONE
but you
hahaha
I saw and approved merged the PR
We haven’t done anything to the plugins they updated
so we should be fine
ok
which I’ll take a look tomorrow
I helped with it, so it should be fairly easy


yeah, it should be a single story with the different links
^^
:’9
I was opening hangout already
/giphy cry
it’s the issues reported on that tool yarden shared
do you have the url at hand?
I can
it’s in the email with subject `My campbells Okta user password`
whee?
Dax can help
you can create a separate function to enqueue it, if `is_single()` and post type is `product`
or you can add the ignore line comment
so phpcs ignores it
yes
something like that
a couple of code style errors
in that PR
google doesn’t detect that?
I assumed no scrum since yarden is at campbell's
getting in now
<https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-campbells-sauces-theme/pull/109> failed
you can edit the check.sh
change phpcs to phpcbf
run it once
and then change it back
I know
It is so it fixes those “errors” automatically
we run check.sh locally
that’s what I mean
it’s for readability
also, all those elements could have a common class when open, so you can just call removeClass on them
I assume there are other elements that may also have the `open` class, that you don’t want to close
that’s interesting
we would need to run an import
found the issue
do you mind if I push to your branch?
with the fixes
ok
we both did the exact same thing
:simple_smile:
I’ll add just one more thing
yes
they will have to do it
yeah
PR is already approved
haha
new PR created from matt’s branch
:simple_smile:
<https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-campbells-sauces-theme/pull/110>
regex should be first started as strings separated with `+` for line breaking
and then use `new RegExp()` to convert them to regex
the others strings should be broken with `+` too
The rule is for readability
`emailRegExp = new RegEx( emailRegExp );`
yes
// jscs:ignore maximumLineLength
for that one line
ok
click
checked, fixed and merged
also: <https://wordpress.org/news/2016/05/wordpress-4-5-2/>
I fixed the regex for email, and a bug in the slider for the campbell’s history
tiny stuff
<https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-brand-parent-theme/commit/a4723c5c8a0076fb6b6f5c90f069051063d894cb>
True that
I pretty much had to override the email share function
so it works as we want it to

ok I'll check it now
<https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-brand-parent-theme/pull/215>
/giphy pikachu light
Yes
I’m working on organizing the parent theme
so we might as well merge that with the new standards
if anyone else is going to apply the new code standards in the child themes, do it on a separate branch
I got a bunch of errors
but most of them are
```End of line character is invalid; expected "\r\n” but found "\n”```
do you have your keys on github?
try removing the `csc-standards` folder
and running ./check.sh again
there has to be one if you ever ran ./check.sh before
on the theme folder you’re working on
screenshot / copy paste of the whole error?
I think we can handle new \r\n with the .editorconfig
double check your public key is on github
<https://help.github.com/articles/error-permission-denied-publickey/>
<https://help.github.com/articles/error-permission-denied-publickey/#make-sure-you-have-a-key-that-is-being-used>
have phpcbf fix them at once
but for new code, I’ll add the rule in .editorconfig
so it is done by sublime
to the parent for now
ok
<!here|@here>: Fix for newline errors:
in `.editorconfig` change `end_of_line` to `end_of_line = crlf`
If you’re not using .editorconfig, please install: <https://github.com/sindresorhus/editorconfig-sublime>
whee
not yet
but we’re going to need to phpcsignore those lines
because that’s how the items come from the API
```
foreach ( $mail_lists as $list ) {
			if ( $list-&gt;StatusId === 1 ) {
				$api_mail_lists[ $list-&gt;Name ] = $list-&gt;Name;
			}
		}
```
it says the check.sh is not there =/
^^
can you help?
ah ok
`/bin/bash^M: bad interpreter: No such file or directory`
are the eol not compatible with linux?
:smile:
jenkins is not finding it
your computer will
ah ok
betta
so if we allow \n we should decide now
before merging the PR Steven sent
is that `infinite-brand.php` different from the one on the parent theme?
if not, we can remove it and handle it on the parent theme
Yeah, I was referring to the screenshot Tyler sent
I’ll go ahead and merge CK PR. Jenkins seems to be fine now with the check.sh
search-product.php?
if it’s not different from the parent theme, you can remove it too
(try searching after you do to make sure)
The check.sh will keep having issues with the new line character
if we edit it
unless we put a special rule for it on .editorconfig
:wink:
One sec
Arriving at the computer
Did you do npm install?
What project is that?
Add jscs to the npm json
Copy it from the one on the parent theme
:smile:
updated package.json and ran npm install?
try removing node_modules once more
computers are for crazy people
you can try the same thing twice and get different results
haha
<https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-brand-parent-theme/pull/223>
yes
?
yes
it still needs the -2
It’s tricky, because the permalink is then translated to something like `index.php?product=$matches[1]`
and then it just searches in the DB the post that is `post_type=product&amp;post_name=blabla`
don’ be so sure!
this annoying faq bug is annoying
:smile:
whee
you’re calling a taxi?
or are you watching the Taxi movie?
I DON’T GET IT
my theories were better
/giphy oooooooh
that wasn’t the idea
but I’ll take it
<http://www.generadormemes.com/media/created/xsxa5i.jpg>
there doesn’t seem to be an actual road
maybe people are just dumb and go there anyways
there are videos of people flying when the plane passes, on that beach
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6ZecN5s0kU>
yes, it is not one of those transformers
fake videos
what?
they probably do
they og ok
yeah he did
he said he’ll continue working on it from home
REDIRECTS ARE DONE
let me help
push what you have to a branch
so I can take a look
Ok
found the issue
you were looking at the wrong bug :stuck_out_tongue:
and it was my fault
sorry
one sec
<https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-brand-parent-theme/pull/231/>
When updating the new coding standards, I replaced `esc_html_e` to just `echo esc_html`, and that function does not translate. It was changed because of a new rule that requires translation functions arguments to be literals, not variables. So it expects `esc_html_e(‘thestring’, ‘domain’);` not `esc_html_e($thestring, ‘domain’);`.
I had to ignore the rule in our `Wordpress-Rain-Extra-Strict` ruleset
no you weren't
<http://cscrain.staging.wpengine.com/campbells/campbell-soup/chunky/hearty-pizza-with-sausage-and-pepperoni-soup-microwavable-bowl/>
:smile:
Now we just need  to push to devcsc
whee
should we go and merge the permanent override feature?
one sec
in scrum
:thumbsup:
What Tyler said

priti plis wit chugar ontoc
graciela
maybe
you tell me: <http://cscrain.staging.wpengine.com/campbells/campbell-soup/condensed/>
<https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-campbells-sauces-theme/pull/129>
that’s the fix
ready to be merged into csc-develop
the function is already declared in the parent theme
that was the error
we were declaring it in both templates
and it’s back: <http://devcsc.wpengine.com/campbells-sauces-2/>
noyce
they still should enable `orderby rand`
go into /wp-admin
tick “enable orderby"
the end
more seriously:
<http://wpexplorer-themes.com/total/docs/random-order-wpengine/>
no
just the category
(fingers crossed)
haha
just delete
the category
haha
ok
:slightly_smiling_face:
kewl
hahahahah
let’s all send a group photo to yarden
so she can print and place in her desk
sure
we can also break dance
will teach us
:O
/giphy :O
:nail_care:
Got it
¿¿¿????
I watched it
haha
doesn’t it let you choose internal or external page?
we would have to update the part where the link is retrieved
and the link updated in all sites
then, that’s all :slightly_smiling_face:
yeah, you’re right
it would be best to have both options, like we have on some slides
I can do it if you want
:)
jenkins seems to be back
WHEEEEE
I was hitting refresh on builds.media...
hahaa
:O
Ok
it looks like the single-product.php file is missing
why?
aham
<http://devcsc.wpengine.com/campbells-sauces-2/skillet-sauces/beef-stroganoff-sauce/>
they all work now I think
I saved a brand, to refresh the permalinks
Tell Monik to go to a brand in wp-admin, and just hit save
it will refresh the permalinks
and it should fix it
if you have access, you can do it
Yes
<http://devcsc.wpengine.com/campbells-sauces-2/?s=Chicken&amp;from_soups=>
looks like someone deleted the partial for the products
or something else
let me check if the file
is in the repo
ok so no files missing
it’s a bug
working on it
our
ok I have a fix
:smile:
"Product Pages - Social Share Icons:
Facebook - not showing the right content (should be product image and description)"
I think the issue is that FB is not able to load the page
because it’s password protected
all the pages in campbells55
also: <http://campbells55.wpengine.com/campbells-sauces-2/where-to-buy/>, on our staging, Where to buy links to <http://campbells.com/where-to-buy|campbells.com/where-to-buy>
so, is that supposed to be the case?
we dind't
didn't
at least not on cscrain
let me check on devcsc
<http://devcsc.wpengine.com/campbells-sauces-2/where-to-buy/>
there isn’t a faq page in sauces either
so there’s nowhere to point
ok
but on the where to buy
there is a link to FAQ
the page to link is set on theme settings
but sauces doesn’t have a faq page
so we would need to change how that works
or we create a FAQ page, and we just redirect it to <http://campbells.com/connect/faq|campbells.com/connect/faq>
<https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-campbells-sauces-theme/pull/134>
that’s the easiest way to fix it
create an empty faq page, and just redirect it to <http://campbells.com|campbells.com>
that url works with theme settings
you choose a FAQ page
yes
let me check if I
I’m not crazy
I think you’re right
```
home_url = mainAjax.home_url;
faq_url = home_url + '/faqs/‘;
```
line 269
store-locator.js
sorry
already gone
see you monday!
hahaha
ok
hahahaha
it actually is
because the home url is not defined in the mainAjax js
but still, we need to define a better way for that link
ok, so for the FAQ link in the where to buy
it just defaults to `WEBSITEURL/faq/`
right not it’s not working at all (that’s a bug)
but we should decide a way to define that link
we do
Haha
who is Mario?
sounds like a cool guy
joining
link?
invitation?
something?
I have 1 qwuesiton
it is very cute
qwuesiton
of course
don’t drink coffee, eat a qwuesitón
I have this PR ready to include that and Matt’s latest fixes: <https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-campbells-sauces-theme/pull/137>
do you have anything else coming soon?
ok
I don’t think the video thing is fixable for safari
the error we’re getting comes from youtube’s javascript
we would have to hide that play button in osx safari
as we are doing in mobile
it took a long time to figure out why, because it was mobile
yeah, exactly
it’s our thumbnail and play button that’s behaving badly
the actual youtube embed works fine
different browsers handle css differently
we mostly look at chrome
also different safari versions
I have 8
and Francisco has 9
so those kind of things can happen
:smile:
Checking
so many bugs :’(
I looked at it
I still freaked out :stuck_out_tongue:
campbells55
yeah, most of QA was done devcsc
cscrain is missing a lot of things
that’s what Tyler said
the images are now in the parent theme
<http://devcsc.wpengine.com/campbells-soup-2/wp-content/themes/pfw-wp-brand-parent-theme/plugins/email-us/images/upc_codes.png>
so it is a quick fix
link?
to the page where the soup header appears
those fields seem to be not working at all
I changed both to link to campbell soups landing
and they still redirect to the homepage
so definitely a bug
Tyler was going to work on those fields anyway
why?
merged and merged
lovely
haha
ok
on campbells sauces
the videos DO work: <https://devcsc.wpengine.com/campbells-sauces-2/>
problem is what I mentioned before
if youtube videos are on https, the campbells site must be loaded in https too
please confirm on your end: <https://devcsc.wpengine.com/campbells-sauces-2/>
Ok :D
ok, say hi to the client :slightly_smiling_face:
so you won’t say hi to them? rude
All changes are in devcsc now
for the faq link to work, we need to select the faq page in the theme settings
that should be it
it is selected for soups I think
not for sauces
because a faqs page didn’t exist yet, Tyler created it yesterday
THANKS FRANCISCO :unamused:
ok
what?
susbcription thing?
nope, not yet
I just merged into devcsc
it’ll take a while to show up
yeah
beats me
it should not work without ‘option'
haha
that was anakin
trying to impress amidala
command + shift + R?
wait
I’m updating the newsletters list
it works now
and select the where to buy page on the all brands slide
checking
<https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-brand-parent-theme/pull/254>
Do we know if CSC-IT is playing with devcsc?
none of the site is working
Ok
That’s from cscrain
Ahh
Wheeeeeeeee
I rick
You rick
He ricks
We need to enter the URLS with https
in the wp-amin
I see
Checking
I’m getting a 404 in <https://www.campbells.com/sauces/>
yes
I’m sending a PR for that now
:slightly_smiling_face:
Ok, I’ll check that out when the sauces site is back
what was wrong with var `nextEl = $( this ).parentsUntil('section').parent().next( 'section' );` ?
wrong as in did it not work? or was it just ugly?
makes sense
I knows
I was trying to figure out what brought your eye to it
that’s why I asked what was wrong
aaah
makes more sense now
:smile:
thanks
yes
one sec
<https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-brand-parent-theme/blob/staging/scripts/templates/product-detail.js#L175-L186>
&lt;img&gt;: <https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-brand-parent-theme/blob/staging/plugins/contextual-pathing/tracker.php#L29>
Yeah, the browser sends them correctly
but there is not one in the response headers
that’s tricky then
they should not cache any calls to /wp-admin ajax
can they do that?
`/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php`
Or move the whole implementation to JS only
but even then we need to access `admin-ajax.php` uncached for login functionality
27 is the blog id
I included the blog ID so it doesn't confuse the multiple sites under the same domain
Checking
there’s still issues with cache:
<http://preview-dev.campbellsoup.com/sauces/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?nonce=d2ca5f09e6&amp;action=track_page&amp;post_type=product&amp;post_id=23910>
is being cached
so no cookies are returned
it should be: <http://devcsc.wpengine.com/campbells-sauces-2/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?nonce=d2ca5f09e6&amp;action=track_page&amp;post_type=product&amp;post_id=23910>
you’re right
I’m comparing now  <http://preview-dev.campbellsoup.com/sauces/slow-cooker-sauces/southern-bbq-sauce/> with <http://devcsc.wpengine.com/campbells-sauces-2/slow-cooker-sauces/southern-bbq-sauce/>
*on devcsc*
it first calls the image/tracker: <http://devcsc.wpengine.com/campbells-sauces-2/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?nonce=d2ca5f09e6&amp;action=track_page&amp;post_type=product&amp;post_id=23918>
and it responds with the `32_current_page` cookie
then it makes the call to: <http://devcsc.wpengine.com/campbells-sauces-2/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php> with form data `&amp;action=product_back_link`
and it returns `{"url":"http:\/\/devcsc.wpengine.com\/campbells-sauces-2\/slow-cooker-sauces\/","title":"Campbell's\u00ae Slow Cooker Sauces”}`
*on preview-dev*
it first loads <http://preview-dev.campbellsoup.com/sauces/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?nonce=d2ca5f09e6&amp;action=track_page&amp;post_type=product&amp;post_id=23918> which does not return any cookies
and then the call to <http://preview-dev.campbellsoup.com/sauces/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php> with `&amp;action=product_back_link`, which returns `{"url":false,"title":null}`
the `product_back_link` does not work because it gets the info from the first cookie
That’s because of:
```
&lt;?php
// Ignore random requests.
	if ( ! isset( $_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER'] ) ) {
		die();
	}
```
I would get random requests that would mess with the navigation tracking
so I added that
Ok
Sounds good
or a band name
byes byes
Ok
Checking
what is causing that redirect?
<http://cscdev.askcampbellskitchen.com/sauces/campbells/sauces/sauces/sauces/sauces/sauces/sauces/sauces/sauces/sauces/sauces/>
ok, that works
are you not seeing assets being loaded in <http://cscdev.askcampbellskitchen.com/about-us/>?
everything is redirecting to <http://cscrain.wpengine.com/> now
Same thing I saw
Why is it redirecting now?
Me too
:slightly_smiling_face:
Let me know how I can help Steven
there’s things I just haven’t heard about
like the CDN setup :slightly_smiling_face:
ok
click
<http://cscrain.staging.wpengine.com/campbells/campbell-soup/condensed/>
I saved a page to refresh permalink structure
I’ll look into making that more automatic
sweet
can we just bypass cloudfront for /wp-admin/*
?
I’ll be having dinner @mention me if you need anything meanwhile
yay for progress!
It would be great if I can look at that setup afterwards, so I can help on it next time
as in reproducing the bug?
yes it works
I mean
I had to clear cache to see it working now :slightly_smiling_face:
(looking at the implementation for the login for an educated answer)
Is the cache aware of $_POST data?
<https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-brand-parent-theme/blob/staging/plugins/pfw-campbells-user.php#L124-L136>
I think as long as the cache is stored with the $_POST data, it should work
Then I think will work :slightly_smiling_face:
Can you set it up so I can test?
cool
yay seems to work fine :slightly_smiling_face:
<http://cscdev.askcampbellskitchen.com/connect/newsletter/>
ok
so it listens to the header
ok
Internet is down at home -.-
No cable either
Yay
Ok
“forgot password” seems to work fine
yes
huh
interesting

Yes. You can test it in devcsc








































./check.sh




whee





the hub theme contained a file (single-product.php) that no longer exists in the repository, I deleted manually
maybe jenkins isn’t deleting files?
same for single-brand.php
finally?
it was not deploying
works now
FINALLY
haha
Thank you
















day?

















is the utah office having internet connection issues?
campbell’s builds have been very slow when installing composer stuff
```The "<https://packagist.org/packages.json>" file could not be downloaded: failed to open stream: Connection timed out

Ok
Thanks!

haha
ok
That is my priority now, I’ll update later tonight
orsooner
or sooner
:simple_smile:
dulce!
yes
haha
BTW
I
I
AG
I’m trying to figure out an issue with the check.sh
on my local repo
I’ll update when we figure it out
<https://github.com/mediarain/WordPress-Coding-Standards/commit/c167808c0c0208bf0347bce65a83d577012f7224>
This breaks the check.sh
in all campbells projects
in js, it interprets blank lines as multi-line function calls
it looks like jenkins is using another standard, therefore, doesn’t show the same errors
^^
^^^
Also
the problem seems to be that phpcs is applying php rules to the javascript files?
<https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer/blob/master/CodeSniffer/Standards/PEAR/Sniffs/Functions/FunctionCallSignatureSniff.php#L394>
That error is for php, from PEAR
Yes, I
I
AG
I’m checking how to exclude all js files
or maybe only use --extensions=php ?
so it only checks php
that seems to fix my life :simple_smile:
it may have it
I want it to be open
in case we want to include a theme/site specific plugin
or some kind of override
true
thanks
I will
^^
That sounds good :)
Including the locator plugin?
haha
if it comes to be necessary, I’d like to clean that thing
Separate please

lol








Ok
wait
not main channel
:smile:





: )
noted
It may still be useful
*downloading*
It's still the same as the JPEG you sent before, right?
Are we getting a pivotal tracker project for this?
Coo
l
and I were discussing using the Advanced Custom Fields (or similar) plugin, with a repeater field to create a more simple "page builder". It can be done in a couple of hours and leaves us with less fighting with the Semplice.
Great
Cool :simple_smile:
Hey there, sorry for the late response, tonsilitis is never your friend.  Daniel and I divided the work, I'm doing section 4 to the bottom. So that goes in line with the custom post types I was assigned.
Yeah. But I'm going to the pulmonologist right now. Third tonsillitis in 3 months

Starting to feel better
Yes I am
I'm getting in sync with Daniel so I can start working on it this afternoon and over the weekend
Sure
Hello, just want to update that I'll be sending a PR for the Where To Buy section later tonight
I just sent that PR
I'll work tomorrow on the FAQ and Footer, I think I can have them both ready by the end of the day

I started working on using the custom post types to display the flavors and FAQ, should I leave that for later, and work on the new stories instead?
I mean, are you planning on showing the client the html/css only?
Responsive/mobile
Ok
Cool
I did already
:simple_smile:
Sounds great
Yeah, I'm checking that out
How do we get approval of a plugin?
I'd like to use this one <https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-page-ordering/screenshots/>
For easy drag&amp;drop of FAQ and Flavors
Otherwise the field in the editor should suffice
Yeah
I just sent a branch with the custom post types implemented in the frontend
I'll create a PR
work on the bugs from the email
Yeah, I have to do that before submitting the PR
I will check it
any word on the plugin approval?
I'm working on the fixes from yesterday's email (from Andy Sheffield)
today also
Is it possible to get the designer to fix an image for me?
Nevermind
OOPS
fixing it
Fixed
I asked myself the same :/
The noodles is my bad
Fixing it
Ok
Yes, test.png is the right now
The other one isn't
Yeah
Forgot to name it correctly afterwards
I was testing :simple_smile:
Ok
Did you remove my background images?
no problemo
I'll push in a few
That was intentional
so now I would like to go step by step on the Dev document
to see if we're missing something
specially in what should and shouldn't be editable
and how
Ok
<!channel>: I just added to pivotal all the features that must be there (from the dev specs doc). This should be helpful for everyone, specially for  to check if everything is as it should.
said he was working on it
He's in English class
I'm supposed to be too :stuck_out_tongue:
That was fixed yesterday
Is it still sitting on top of the footer text?
Ok
: D
I think style.css isn't compiled to the latest in the staging
I will push in a few
And make sure the style.css is compiled
For the footer custom fields, I will implement the Options page
can you please check the PR so I can go ahead and insert the content in the staging version?
zenks!
let me send you an user
check your email
I'll work on the recently received changes (the lid thing)
hi
I did take a look
Is my plugin there and I missed it?
Is the products-recipe a must? Because it looks nothing like what we are using
For the flavors
Unless its meant for something else?
It has fields for the nutritional facts
that's the gist of it
and it has a recipes custom post type
Yes, we can have that
There is a "post type selector" field in ACF
Ok
Ok
There you go
The plugin needed tweaking
did you check the store locator PR?
What do you need me to tweak?
oh ok
There you go
what do you get?
Hi
Ok
Ok
So link it to <http://www.econsumeraffairs.com/csc/locator/> instead of the plugin?
ask for a password reset?
nevermind
new pass: yosoyfrancisco1234$$$
AHHHH
lol
one sec
User: demoPassword: ded034
fixed
I just sent the PR
That means we get to leave early? :smile:
Or modal?
:simple_smile:
Ok
It appears that fb no longer allows one to set the messange?
*message
I have it for twitter
It is finished
it won't appear in the plugins list
Also, I was asked to "hide" it for now
Sounds good
That's ok
I'm finishing the changes from yesterday's email
Yes
Ok
Is the design ready?
Ok
Sounds good
^^^
You can see/try the Store locator at <http://campbellstowe.staging.wpengine.com/?page_id=39>
Yes, the sheets file says they won't be up until ~ 1 week
Is it going to be displayed in a lightbox? I've been working based on that
Otherwise we need to create a page template
thatl ooks good
Yes, but not with the MOA from the sheet
MOA ids
Ok
I can add one product
with another MOA
so the designer can try it himself
oh Ok
Hi Remy :smile:
haha
<http://campbellstowe.staging.wpengine.com/?page_id=39>
It includes now a "Product with results" product
which will
in fact
believe it or not
return results
:simple_smile:
you is guelcom
I'm on the plugins thing
Just making some coffee before I continue :simple_smile:
There you go
Yeah, about that
Do they keep them in a repository because they can have a list?
Or because they modify them?
Ok
:snake:
snakelicious?
I don't know
I just liked the emoji
:stuck_out_tongue:
Ok
Wait until I place my selfie on the product locator
It should make it best website eva
Store locator design should be done today or early tomorrow the latest
BUT
Wasn't it easier to do
if (get_field('whatever') != '') ?
server side
:smile:
Hi, I'm finishing over lunch
Finishing the locator
I'm stuck with something lame
:disappointed:
%%
^^
nevermind
I just spoke with Daniel
and he's already building basic page/post templates
so I'll just let this be it's own template
I just wanted it to be one size fits all
But I guess you can't have everything in life!
:simple_smile:
two
2: talk to daniel, he's a couple of steps away
can it wait ~20 mins?
I'm doing the white box nightmare thing
There it is
HAPPY WEEEKEEEND
BYEEEEEE
:stuck_out_tongue:
Yeah, I'm checking them
Give me a few minutes
one secundo
try it now
yeah
as always making me look bad
¬¬
:stuck_out_tongue:
I had added a padding bottom
for &lt;article&gt;
I think
yup, sounds betta
&lt;?php if (is_home()): ?&gt;style="margin-top: -150px"&lt;?php endif; ?&gt; should do the trick :stuck_out_tongue:
that's boring

I'm working on something for bloom for women
But I can work on campbells too
if needed
I have only seen it work with zipcode
Let me check when I'm on the Computer
To read the code
Ok
I just sent a PR with the fix for the "City, State" in the product locator
Los Angeles, CA
with "product with results"
I'm fixing the product locator
Only video thumb is missing and  is almost done :smile:
It does seem a bit pixelated in our screens
And we don't have retinas
So I assume they would look more pixelated in those?
is it done via custom field?
because then we just add another custom field for another image
for larger resolutions
Yes, two custom fields. Low res and High
?















bebop?
NOOOO
^^






not me

That's what I'm working on
what Emily said
yep
I meant yes, it can be an example for now

no

Yes it should.
Unless the product is for some reason in another ccnw
What is the MOA?
do you mean the products don’t have MOA?
none of them?
ok
I need those MOA numbers
Cool
<https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-brand-parent-theme/pull/329>
<https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-brand-parent-theme/pull/330>
no
the fields folder is for theme options, or post types we didn't create, but want to add custom fields to it ( like products or recipes )
since the html will be within the code, I don’t think we’ll need code changes in the child theme.
is it possible that devcsc’s cdn is caching calls to admin-ajax.php ?
they are all returning `-1` and I can’t replicate it locally or cscrain
no, there’s no limit
if you add more, they will go in a side dropdown
ok
you’re right, but something is killing all ajax requests in devcsc, see: <http://devcsc.wpengine.com/v8-2/products/>
not for me, and not for most
I think we had this issue before
but I can’t remember what it was
maybe
let me try incognito
yes
incognito works
agh
so my guess is, something is messing with the `wp_ajax_` actions
the `wp_ajax_nopriv` works, the other doesn’t, yay
I enabled all the plugins they have (except tealium and and sign-in requirements) in my local, it still works
checking on cscrain now
do you know if CSC-IT is trying to debug? I see some `console.log` on the JS, that are not in our or their repo
so it looks like it was uploaded manually
I think my issue is that devcs’s urls (most of them) have been changed to https
all the ajax calls are being made to `<https://devcsc.wpengine.com/swanson-2/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php>`
but the call is being made from `<http://devcsc.wpengine.com/swanson-2/broth/>`
that would break the nonce
and trying to load `<https://devcsc.wpengine.com/swanson-2/broth/>` just redirects me to the non https
I think my issue is that devcs’s urls (most of them) have been changed to https
did you see my message about ajax and https?
the AJAX requests are being forced to https, also the whole WP admin. Frontend is forced to http.
it doesn’t anymore, and the AJAX works
:slightly_smiling_face:
now to clear cache on the browser
It does not force https anymore on an incognito window, which fixes the AJAX requests
we’ll have to clean our browser caches to remove that redirect
yes

why are all the filters deleted in the product grids?
sorry
we were lunching
buffalo wings
just so you know
:stuck_out_tongue:
nice
I like oreos :stuck_out_tongue:
sent
I’m checking
they work now
whenever permalinks don’t work, we go open any brand in the admin, and hit save
that re-saves the rewrite rules
maybe that should be done better
I’m sending a PR right now
but it will need some styling by
it will allow you to add a filter with no CCNW product line, and no category
and will display it as a title
^^
note: empty filters become `&lt;h7&gt;` now, it will need styling to match the design: <https://projects.invisionapp.com/d/main/default/#/console/8329873/184239717/preview>
<!here|@here> I’m heading out to run an errand, but will be back in ~2 hours
yes, I didn’t go and create it on the admin
let me do that now
see: <https://devcsc.wpengine.com/swanson-2/broths-and-stocks/>
as I said, it needs styling
from Tyler
stock, broth, unsalted and gluten free?
Ok
the filters in the other pages have been hidden with css, that will have to be fixed by frontend
I’ll leave the filters created for now
<https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/129567951>
do we want to allow recipes in the search results?
we don’t have a “single view” for recipes
so we would have to link to CK instead, that can be done
just want to double check
ok
Yep
It does sound like an overkill
Can we php that instead?
So it's cached
Ok
I can take care of that if you want
Ok
Make the story
I'll check it in half an hour
Thanks
can you please check this one? <https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-swanson-theme/pull/103>
zenks
<!here|@here> I’ll be AFK for ~30 minutes
Yes, all brands should be on brands
:slightly_smiling_face:
maybe if gluten free and low sodium are not CCNW product lines, but categories
then it may be fine to leave it as pages
but preferably, brands
check if they appear as CCNW product lines, under products
or as categories
in products -&gt; CCNW PRODUCT LINEs
or products -&gt; CATEGORIES
in the WP ADMIN
<https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-swanson-theme/pull/138>

;0
:slightly_smiling_face:
nope
it’s fixed
I'm focusing on the email us plugin updates. But everything should be functional. I don't have any other tasks assigned.
I’m working on the updates for the email us plugin
which will be ready later tonight
but I think everything else is done
yep
nice
Ariel please clear your cache
^^
They  couldn't complete the form because they didn't see and complete the recaptcha. That would happen if they haven't loaded the latest Javascript. That's why I ask to clear the cache
Cache *
you're welcome
Ok
On it
apparently the recaptcha is trying to run before it’s ready on devcsc (it worked last night and works in my local)
are we able to submit a quick fix to that
ok, so should I send the fix now?
ok
that is what I’m implementing :slightly_smiling_face:
<https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-brand-parent-theme/pull/360>
Also, there’s no need to recompile JS or CSS for campbell’s soup to get the updates
it did need the recaptcha key and secret set, I just did that
now we just need the new fix in place
Ok
done
should be in devcsc in 20-30 minutes
Ok
haha
yeah
some
:slightly_smiling_face:
I think it’s all good to go
see: <https://devcsc.wpengine.com/swanson-2/connect/>
recaptcha is working now
there was a small bug
:smile:
what are you doing in your holiday?
another plugin is also using recaptcha, and breaks my callback
sounds like fun
shooting range tomorrow
with other nica rainers
:smile:
PR sent: <https://bitbucket.org/campbellsoupco/pfw-wp-plugins/pull-requests/4/removed-unused-composer-and-firebase-files/diff>

I did
should we merge that to staging and then send a PR to their repo?
Steven mentioned in DM that we should PR to their repo, since we are in code freeze
so I’m double checking if we should merge to our staging at all
or just send it to their repo in bitbucket
haha
:slightly_smiling_face:
ok
devcsc
in a while
yep
and recaptcha works on <https://devcsc.wpengine.com/campbells-soup-2/connect/>
:slightly_smiling_face:
nice :disappointed:
we are using the field in CK, so I guess I assumed we did on the parent theme
URL?
those are weird urls
those product urls are seriously broken
the correct url is
<http://campbells55.wpengine.com/swanson-2/flavor-infused-broth/mexican-tortilla-flavor-infused-broth/>
but something is breaking how they are displayed
(the links)
oh
ok
I understand why they were broken
and tyler’s fix make sense
yay
I guess we can improve how that works
as in, get  a “final” permalink, instead of whatever it is, if it’s a draft
does it make sense?
we still get first the brand permalink
but a final one
it would always be the same
the issue is that the permalink for the draft was `
<https://preview.campbells.com/swanson/?post_type=brand&amp;p=1309>
and the permalink for the published brand is 
<http://campbells55.wpengine.com/swanson-2/flavor-infused-broth/>
so the fix would ALWAYS get the second one, regardless of the status of the post
that would break the lazy loading
where do you want the do_shotcode?
ah
ok
on it
<http://campbells55.wpengine.com/swanson-2/wp-admin/|campbells55.wpengine.com/swanson-2/wp-admin/>
maybe
it has worked with the same login for me
it loads a blank page for you?
ah
then maybe
I use Steven's
yes
Tyler is fixing it

the fix for the images padding is now on it’s way to devcsc
checking
yes
that
Everything from me should be done now
there is a product category
that contains them
not ccnw product line
yes
I’m fixing the filters
but haven’t submitted anything yet
I do have a fix
yep
also
there is a bug with ACF
and we will need to do with this instead:
ok
I can make the change in the swanson theme only
Ok
I agree
ok
I think I should still send the fix for the ccnw product line and categories select
the select for some reason retrieves the terms from all taxonomies
the checkbox works fine
and we would not need to re-select everything
ok
sending PR
<https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-brand-parent-theme/pull/375>
Yes
Shoot
I'm driving now but will be available in around 2 hours
Ok
the main difference between those two files is:
- it uses the placeholder image
- it uses the recipe image url custom field instead of the hardocded url
both things can be moved into the parent theme
also, the filter is easier to do for now
I’m doing that
and <https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-brand-parent-theme/pull/377>
That is all right?
wheee
No, but there are a lot of parts in the theme that call `get_field` without checking if it exists
but <https://devcsc.wpengine.com/v8-2/> is loading for me
did you enable the plugin?
wheee
I love it when no code is needed
that is right
As soon as I'm done with lunch is good?
^^
wait
some css needs to be gone too
now it’s ready
<https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-swanson-theme/pull/176>
<https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-swanson-theme/pull/176>
I also don’t have an idea
because the bootstrap error seems unrelated
(as in, I get it in my local, but it still works)
could it be loading different bootstrap versions?
yes
we need to push to csc-develop
after this PR is merged, the product locator will be fixed on devcsc
it is
<https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/1752517/stories/130396663>
@shaun ^^
the issue is that there is no content on that page
and if I set it as draft, then it’s products won’t have the “flavor infused broth” tagline
we would have to implement it now

OMG
can I tell my mom?
up where?
they crop however they want
:disappointed:
that’s the jquery the whole site is using
it’s not specific to the email us plugin
I’m getting a “too much recursion” error
from jquery
let me take a look at that function in js
ok
I have a fix
:slightly_smiling_face:
This is the fix for the recursion bug in firefox: <https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-swanson-theme/pull/180>
it was
you just need to add a check for an email us dom element, before the observer declaration
problem is that the product locator uses `’#product-name’` too
yep

we updated the site id
and that should work
not sure what else is new in the plugin

there’s also a PR in the parent theme
Yes
But the product locator is in the parent theme
pfw-wp-brand-parent-theme
The child theme inherits most functionality from the parent theme. In the best case scenario, the child theme will only contain css needed
Yes
we use a single WP multisite install
for all the projects
so each site should be a sub-site of your main WP install
I thought you had already installed one for CK?
because I told you do to that
<https://codex.wordpress.org/Create_A_Network> has the steps, it’s pretty easy
I told you to make a multisite install when you had issues installing it on campbells.dev and it needed to be on campbells.dev/recipes/
It was one google away
no problem
It looks like some files are missing (i.e: the one that defines `wp_get_current_user()`
the `get_field()` error is caused by the Advanced Custom Fields not being installed
`wp_get_current_user()` is defined at <https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/tags/4.5.3/src/wp-includes/pluggable.php#L68>
PRO is fine
is the `wp-includes/pluggable.php` file there?
I’m reading the www-xml-sitemap-generator-org plugin can cause that issue in multisite installs
do you have that one active?
also, in your wp-config.php add: `define('WP_DEBUG', true);`
that should help with the debugging
these are the pluggins I have network enabled on my local install:
- ACF PRO
- Campbell Product and Recipe Post Types
- Piklist
set it to true, see if you can get more errors to find out what’s missing
so you didn’t find `wp-includes/pluggable.php`?
there should be both `wp-includes/pluggable.php` and `wp-includes/pluggable-deprecated.php`
I would re-download a fresh .zip from <http://wordpress.org|wordpress.org> and copy-&gt;replace the wp-includes folder
Do you have any of the default WP themes installed?
Have you created a sub site already?
that sounds like it
you have to go to Sites -&gt; Edit Site -&gt; Themes
and choose the ones you want enabled on each site
OR
You go to Themes and Network Enable them
I have a meeting and then Scrum, @daniel is finishing touches,  how busy are you?
You can help without getting the env setup
Basically, we need to run a diff on both versions of the locator plugin
or more specifically
you can identify the custom changes we’ve made to the product locator on the parent theme
and apply them to the version they provided
does that make sense?
if I remember correctly, it’s 100% js
so you can move forward with that, and we can regroup in the afternoon to help finish setting up the dev env.
and test
let me find the old version of the plugin without our custom changes
so it’s easier to identify
you can run a diff between those 2
and then apply to the newer version
I think that’s the same version, without our changes
unless you see more than 200 lines changes, that means it’s not the same version
let me know so I can continue digging
we need to re-implement our changes into the new version of the plugin
Ok
so that means soup for breakfast?
much better!
can you upload it to a branch on the parent theme repo?
so we can see the diff and etc
I will
as far as I can remember, most of it should be JS changes, but there could be a few php changes
it’s best to look everywhere
cool
will go up and help you finish setting up the dev environment
I moved your “setup environment” tasks in pivotal to their respective projects
if you haven’t been added to those projects, please let Yarden and Ariel/Emily know
the locator hasn’t been pushed yet
the testing in all the brand sites should happen on monday, I guess

I said the product locator should be tested on Dax environment since Bruce didn't have his env working.
P
I think Bruce got his env working on Friday afternoon. So he should be able to test it locally with Daniel or Dax help
Dulce
was the showPosts bug fixed?
I added a check on my brand parent theme branch to avoid that bug
Sounds right
Cool
The enygma sounded like fun
:(
Yes. With the user api plugin. The Ajax newsletter in the theme has the code that does that
Wheee
Yes it can. We should make functions to handle the Ajax calls. And separate code for the forms "states" handling.







:shuffle_party_parrot:
:smile:
I will
ok
no new branches for that?
ok
kewl
The newsletter nonce is defined in the functions.php
it should always be there
if not, then that’s a bug
yes
that’s right
ok, then we should just use the one in newsletter settings
so I was wrong
those nonces seem to be printed with the slide
but if the functionality is consolidated, then we should include it in the functions.php, in the mainAjax object
you only configure what mail lists you want there
the nonce is generated in the slide template
<https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-brand-parent-theme/blob/staging/slides/slide-newsletter-form.php#L170>
maybe no styles in swanson
are there styles for that in <http://campbells.com|campbells.com> ?
all pushed to devcsc
@dax and  are about to send some new stuff for video and posts (ajax)
maybe it would be better after that
what do you think?
I have a fix for that
but it’s with all my other search stuff work
BUT I think I can send it as it is right now
without breaking anything
so we would have updates from Daniel, Dax, and me
in the next ~30 minutes
+ the time to deploy
does that sound good?
dulce
can you please check this one? <https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-brand-parent-theme/pull/455>
The code is most likely there, we have used the same repo and branch for swanson-2
but yes, we have to test everything there
to make sure it’s all working
ok
Ok. Daniel was focused on CKs tech doc
But we'll work on that with Dax too
Yes it is
:)
Matt. If you can finish the filters html and styling today. I can apply the required code.  However. We still have no idea what filters will be there. That's why I said on Wednesday that it was best if we could progress on the html.
We'll be in the office in 20 minutes
I can merge PR then
Are we talking about global search or recipes search?
ok
so it’s mostly frontend
we still don’t know what filters we’re going to have
ok
so it’s mostly frontend
=/
You can style each partial. There is the recipe card. Which I don't think will change. And there's the search-product.php file you can change what you need.  And I'll work on the backend, to display results in that new order.
those are the files we’ll work with on the swanson theme:
- global-search.php (the main file that calls the other partials)
- search-product.php
- search-recipe.php (I think this one will end up just including the partials/recipe-card.php
- content-search.php (for blog posts)
^

:aussie_parrot:
We are not doing any filtering. But I'll double check the API response.
<!here|@here> I updated the coding standards on the swanson and parent themes, if you work on it, make sure to pull the latest
we can remove the slides
and then add them back
or do you mean the entire page?
that can also be done
from the menu settings
we would have to remove the slide, and add it back later on
no code needed
just re-entering the slide info
can you please try again your okta/campbells logins?
Mine seems to almost work, except that I don’t have admin access to the well-yes site (the reason accounts were created)

ok, we may need to at least recompile css's on the child theme
but the child themes compile their css from the parent theme less
Ok
the product locator has it
<https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-brand-parent-theme/blob/staging/plugins/cmpbl-store-locator/less/style.less#L1>
we would have to recompile that less
I think that's what I previously did
I removed that line
and recompiled the less on the plugin
I agree
on it
that includes other styling too
not sure if we are based on it for anything
I just sent a PR with that style.css without the bootstrap
<https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-brand-parent-theme/pull/486>
or I guess we can remove it completely, and add some more styling
-.-
ok
wait
can we update the bootstrap less to be contained inside the slide class?
ok
I got it all inside ..store-locator-app {
so they won't bleed
sending new PR
looking at the production site
that's what I did last time too
so yay
(for not remembering)
<https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-brand-parent-theme/pull/488>
yes
I'm also bumping version numbers
I'll send PRs
I'm looking at it
problem is, there's the newsletter callout
and the connect form
and both have different implementation of the captcha
fun fun fun
do they work on production?
on IE and Edge
:smile:
dulce
:parrot_dad:

I think it is
does it have the new content?
ok then no
let me check
<http://preview.campbells.com/swanson/> ?
NOPE
wait
it was <http://preview.campbells.com/swanson/>
seems to be not working now
not necessarily
i.e: we had /campbells-kitchen-2/ in devcsc but preview is /kitchen
I think <https://campbells55.wpengine.com/swanson-3/>, but it's not through CDN
whooooo
where is it not pointing to the new /kitchen/ URL?
yes
but then it redirects you to the final URL
no, I just pushed it to devcsc
We need to ask CSC-IT to push to production
we still have another few tickets pending
maybe we should wait to have them delivered and tested, so they can be all pushed at once
I think they can be done tomorrow.
there's only one new bug, that was logged today, and most of pending tasks seem to be done but not delivered
only emily is left
I see pending tasks delivered
so it's QA time
(on preview-dev)
emails are not passing = form submits but email is not sent?
ok
Ok I'll do that
Wheeeeeeee
we entered the email address in the "email us" settings
it's not recaptcha related
the email address the email should be sent to
(one sec)
<mailto:campbellus@cybercrs.net|campbellus@cybercrs.net>
OK
the solution was to use the recipe id instead :slightly_smiling_face:
Because there's a chance the slugs could be manually changed in CK. And that would cause broken links coming from external sites.
Matt, frontend
jenkins hasn't complained
so it should be there
:parrot_dad:
I don't think so, we haven't updated it in a few days
I just checked bitbucket, master is up to date with develop
same in github
:parrot_dad:
:fastparrot:
did we hear back about the cookies and CDN I mentioned the other day?
`%_previous_page`,` %_current_page`
yes, that's why I think it's an issue with the CDN settings




I was going to suggest that
but then I forgot :fastparrot:
:parrot_dad:
That works for me
can we move it 0.5 hours later?
it's our lunch time
and we don't have a kitchen yet
so we have to go out
preferably 1 hour later?
I am, Daniel is too
not sure if Jason is back?
I wrote the code to fetch the brands from CK in the migration settings, and added the endpoints. I'm working on sending the terms and then the final request with the collections. Daniel finished the slide changes, he's now working on the collection single page.
we have a office meeting today at the same hour as the scrum
so that would be our update for now
unless you move the scrum to some time after 2.30
nica time
The one at 1pm?
Ok
Ok
they will be
I have ~80% of the migrations done
whee
or do we not need that?
Steven said that the recipes would link to CK
Or you told Steven
:smile: :smile: :smile:
then we're good
Daniel and I are finishing today
we can QA tomorrow
who will QA this?
:aussie_parrot:
is it like that in devcsc?
please remember to assign or link the PRs in the parent theme, that repo doesn't post to any slack channel
I can't push anything to devcsc because WDS has introduced some code with coding standards errors
That would also be a blocker for tomorrow's push of collections migrations
please discuss it with Emily
I see new commits
let me pull the latest and see
yes we are
they have pushed some changes but their code still has coding standard errors
so our jenkins is not able to push or pull anything from their repo


kind of
:slightly_smiling_face:
explanation:
The migrations plugin imports collections correctly, and Daniel's slide and collection single page are deployed to devcsc.
BUT
The collections in devcsc are broken
some (or a lot) of the collections have broken relations to the recipes
but should work well enough for testing
once CSC-IT merges the latest changes to the CK theme to production (PR already sent), we can migrate from there, and have everything working correctly
we can also use the same migration plugin to pull the 100% working collections from production, into devcsc
again, once csc-it merges the latest
Please
<https://bitbucket.org/campbellsoupco/pfw-wp-campbells-kitchen/pull-requests/6/api-endpoints-for-collections-migration/diff>
It contains the necessary updates and new endpoints for collections migrations.
I will
Yes, they need to be imported already
I think you also established that in the tech doc








ok
I’m on it
<https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-v8-theme> ?
deadline?
I’m on social dental, just figuring out priorities
ok
** 26 days layer **
hey, I just finished the tasks
:simple_smile:


:disappointed:
AFAIK, I can work on those two tasks
are there more?
ok
I think I’m good with that
:simple_smile:
lol
Articles Callout Header - not required.
is that the slider title? or the article title?
ok
ok
yes
ok
Ok
So we need to remove the brand part of the permalink, correct?
Ok
I have it locally, but a copy of the latest DB would be nice
do you have an example of the product permalink not working?
they work for me
The problem is that faq is also the slug for the FAQ custom post type
and it has priority
I changed the page slug to faqs
and works fine
so we can do that, or tell wordpress to ignore the custom post type url
<http://devcsc.wpengine.com/v8/faqs/>
but for the products, permalinks work on my end
:simple_smile:

It is
Yes
the title field
I think they copied the theme from <http://campbells.com|campbells.com> there was code for that there. Otherwise I can do it
ok
means the “FILTER” text, I think
yep

new wordpress install and import?
oh
:disappointed:
I am
Ok
Will do
nuay faifarifa
haha
it means “no problem"
spanish
nica
not lying!
haha
nuay = no hay
faifarifa = falla = problem
it’s gonna be super useful
and you will thank me
*mi
I sent a PR for the “you may also like"
Iwhat is needed?
ok
which one?
ok
where are the comps?
comps = design?
I don’t have a password to that
: )
ok
I’ll hardcode that
BUT
I remember
there was a
“virtual page” custom post type for <http://campells.com|campells.com>
we could create one
and have the product detail
load the slides from that one
we specify
in the settings
well, we could add any slides we want
yes
Ok
with?
Ok
I will update it with the virtual page
Yes
not yet, will be in an hour
no problemo
<https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-v8-theme/pull/70>
so who’s in charge of the content?
who should I tell how to setup the slides for the product detail?
seems to be going to the bottom?
not middle aligned
I created the red loader with <http://ajaxload.info/>
:smile:
It's done
First, you create a Virtual Page
And add the slides to it
Then you go to theme settings -&gt; product detail
and select there the virtual page you created
any slides that you add to that virtual page, will be added to all of the product details
Only yo product details
There is an option for that, I think?
Next to the slide title field
:)

I was working on the product detail header and footer
I only had that assigned on Pivotal
what do you need on the splash?
ok, will I style them?
oh ok
cool :simple_smile:
can you check my PR?
Ok
Looking at it now
so for this task, what about adding the virtual page to the brand? so all the products can inherit it. And we can add an option for the products callout slide to show RAND products, but from a specific CCNW
like?
does my idea sound good to you?
Great
Idea is to have different virtual pages. And each brand is connected to one virtual page. The product details inherits that virtual page.
Also, the product callout slide is extended to show random products from specifics CCNWS
the product callout slide template? not yet
who?
there is a brand
and a page
with the splash
slug
so what you see is the brand page
it has priority
<http://devcsc.wpengine.com/v8/wp-admin/post.php?post=14069&amp;action=edit>
I don’t remember that
but I’ll check
just add it back
I just finished the you might also like (slides virtual page per brand), and will move to search, since it’s a quick fic
fix*
That will be next.
^^^
No easy way, we would need a second GET parameter for the header/footer (as we did on <http://campbells.com|campbells.com>), and then alter the global $wp_query
to filter
based on that
if someone can check and merge my PR, would be great
:thumbsup:
/giphy thumbsup
should we support the ccnw-product-lines taxonomy right from the template? otherwise importing gets complicated because it doesn’t find it at first
currently taking care of the urls
so for the permalinks
I have “fixed” what was causing wordpress to prioritize the brand instead of the pages
problem now is, that in <http://campbells.com|campbells.com>, products where in a sub brand
campbell-soup/slow-kettle/
so permalinks worked
but we don’t have that in v8-splash
so it tries to show a page, instead of a product, and sends a 404
so I may have a workaround. All pages under the “v8-splash” page will be added to the permalink structure. And the default rule after that, will be for products.
If that makes any sense
Yes, I think I’m almost done
a true/false custom field
“show top banner?” true/false
can someone remind me the comment to tell phpcs to ignore a line?
submitting the PR now so  can review
<https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-v8-theme/pull/127>
who is in charge of fixing content?
I changed the way the product details shows the slides on the bottom
(you may also like)
so now someone needs to create a virtual page v8 splash, and v8
and assign them to the brands
:smile:
^^
yes
right now, it doesn’t show anything, because virtual pages are not set
I just talked to  and he will work on it
<https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-v8-theme/pull/128> anyone?
can anyone check my latest PRs?
so for the FAQ, I have fixed locally the 404 for faqs, however, we don’t have a template for the faq
so it doesn’t show the content
yes, but not a single view
for a faq
we don’t do anything :simple_smile:
<http://www.campbells.com/faq/do-you-have-any-gluten-free-soups/>
yay
?
we could add a redirect
for any /faq/something url to be redirected to /faqs
it does
but it’s hidden
I don’t know
we did that in <http://campbells.com|campbells.com>
and looks like we never did something about it for search
redirect, unless we have a design to show that content
no, redirect is 5 minutes
ok
Yes
ok
are the latest changes on devcsc?
I fixed the line 95 error
and the PR was merged
but It’s still coming up
Ok
added the redirection
<http://devcsc.wpengine.com/v8/faq/what-is-v8r-bloody-mary-mix/>
and other single faqs
now redirect to /v8/faqs
No we don't
It loads it directly from their API
Still working on it
I don’t think I’ll be done before lunch, but probably in the afternoon
making sure
header-alt-two will always be splash, and only splash, right?
Ok
^^^
Yes?
Each faq?
How many are there?
Ah ok
Ok. I can do that
It's 1.35pm here. It should be done by 3pm
yeah, FAQs should be done pretty soon, so nobody needs to work on the weekend :simple_smile:
^^^^^
should review it first I think
^^^
there is a task for meta data
Isn't that done with the seo plugin?
Yes
But I think the plugin is not enabled
Ok
There are new fields in the search section for the theme settings
Those must be filled too for the search to exclude what is needed
Yes. You choose what ccmw product lines, pages (it automatically adds subpage too) and search keywords (from the search api options) you want to *exclude* from each section
No
There is a field for faqs keywords from the faq api
*Exclude* keywords, yes
so I have a fix
anybody available to merge my changes?
yay
can we now merge that into devcsc?
I just found that we also get the brand v8-splash result, when on v8, I could change the page exclude field
to also enable brand choosing
to avoid that
what do you think
?
Ok
It’s ok to show the brand? Or ok to make the change?
In Splash, it shows the V8 brands, so I think we should make the change
It was set to only choose pages
But adding brands is just two more lines
I’ll send a PR
Ok, will do
I get a lot of notices for the nutrition data
Notice: Undefined index: calories in /Users/peachepe/Rain/v8/wp-content/themes/pfw-wp-v8-theme/single-product.php on line 175

Notice: Undefined index: calories-fat in /Users/peachepe/Rain/v8/wp-content/themes/pfw-wp-v8-theme/single-product.php on line 175

Notice: Undefined index: fat-total in /Users/peachepe/Rain/v8/wp-content/themes/pfw-wp-v8-theme/single-product.php on line 175
I’m working on a fix for the nutrition data
There was a bug in the nutrition data. You were using the “slugs” and then nutritional data array uses the array key. I fixed that. Also, using the daily values array you provided, at least in <http://devcsc.wpengine.com/v8/v8-veggie-blends/blends-healthy-greens/>, most of the values are not stored, so only 5 items are shown, however, without using that order, there are 12 items that have data. Is that the intended behavior?
Sending PR.
So for simplicity, we redirected all FAQS to the `/faqs/` page. But now, if you’re on Splash, and click on a FAQ result, it takes you to the V8 faq page. What should we do? I guess adding a `single-faq` view will be the solution.
^^^
Or. We could modify the permalinks as we did on the products. Based on the keyword we change it to faqs or v8-splash/faqs
We can. I would like to hear back from you and  on which of my 2 ideas implement
I'll work on the redirect then
Working on it
I don’t have a xhttps browser :disappointed:
Ok
I have a fix for the FAQ
^^^
Sweet
Ok
Wait
I’m sending a PR right now
so I finished all the backend tasks. I’ll be out now. If you need anything, mention me here.
Please change the splash faqs url to faqs
<http://devcsc.wpengine.com/v8/v8-splash/faqs/> works for me
<http://devcsc.wpengine.com/v8/faqs/> works too
<http://devcsc.wpengine.com/v8/v8-splash/faqs/what-are-the-top-selling-v8-splash-flavors/> redirects me to <http://devcsc.wpengine.com/v8/v8-splash/faqs/>
<http://devcsc.wpengine.com/v8/faqs/what-are-the-effects-of-drinking-v8-energy-drinks-i-am-pregnant-and-drank-a-whole-container/> redirects me to <http://devcsc.wpengine.com/v8/faqs/>
That is the wanted behavior, right  ?
There’s no 404
/giphy yay!
Yes
You’re right
fixing it now
<!channel>: anyone available for merge into devcsc?
:smile: :smile:
<!channel>: so I triggered a new build for CSCDEV. I guess we’ll see the changes in 20 minutes!
<!channel> I just tried mobile search on devcsc and it worked.
Sweet :simple_smile:
Tyler changed it
I merged it
I’m going to bed now
byes!
are you talking about <https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/110372490> ?
steps to reproduce?
try again please
are you trying incognito window?
kewl
going to bed nows
<!channel> my car's battery is dead. I'll get a ride to go buy a new one. Mention me here if you need anything
I think I might me able to finish it today
I'm having lunch right now. Please give me 1 hour to give a more concrete answer.
Sure
I only have read permissions for <https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-photon-framework>
so I think we should push back on this one
both were right
:simple_smile:
:simple_smile:
I am
!
The locator plugin merge
still working on it :simple_smile:
what issues are therE?
Ok
Not yet
sweet
ajúa!
Yes
hahahhaah
I’m going to quote that from now on
not working how?
windows?
just hangin out - keeping it real
/giphy wheeeee
The veggies for all
is because products don’t seem to have the ccnw_product_line linked
either the brand or the product
So yeah, I confirm it’s the CCNW product lines not being correctly set on import
apparently the ID’s change or somethign
:smile:
I’m fixing the v8 splash brands
<!channel>:
same issue
assigning correct CCNW to brands will fix it
URLS and templates for v8-splash products should work now, please confirm on your end
I’m trying to find out what’s wrong with the splash product grid
yes
none of the product grids are working
I did an import to my local install
and it’s the same
I’m trying to figure it out
(y)
:thumbsup:
It’s weird, I did a local import, fixed CCNW for product grids, and it worked
but it doesn’t work on production
:smile:
Something is wrong
I’m trying to update pages
and I sometimes get the wordpress error page
“are you sure you want to do this?"
<http://campbellsoupco.wpengine.com/v8/v8-splash/> and <http://campbellsoupco.wpengine.com/v8/products/>
those work for you?
yay
<https://github.com/szepeviktor/wordpress-fail2ban/blob/master/wp-fail2ban.php#L248>
is that installed?
it may be killing my product grid1
so which one should I be looking at?
yes
uuhnmmmmmmmmm
lovely
so what are we missing now?
I
is search fixed?
or should I do it?
yeah!
/giphy yeah!
I am
in the search tab
I just completed it
no
yes
keeping it real
Yay
No
it’s with the redirection plugin
and I think I have the updated plugin working
and it looks like it won’t require much styling
just a few fixes
I think there is something wrong with the wpengine cache
the products grid doesn’t work on a cache clean  browser
it shows the -1 again
I think the nonce is being cached
or something like that
search doesn’t use the nonce
only ajax requests
I think CSC-IT
I have no way to check that
again
for osme reason
<http://preview.campbellsoup.com/v8-splash/> does work
*some
what is the issue with search?
checking
ok
search works
properly
it’s that those bloody mary questions
are under a faq keyword
we didn’t have before
KWV8REDRecipe
adding it now
there’s also KWV8REDIngredient
<http://campbellsoupco.wpengine.com/v8/?s=bloody+mary&amp;header=alt-two> works as expected now
Ok, cool
<https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-v8-theme/tree/locator-update> that’s the branch with the updater locator plugin. there’s some little styling needed
well,  said that if it works on <http://preview.campbells.com|preview.campbells.com> it will work on live
we don’t have access to the FAQ plugin settings
I think so
Feel free to ping me too
huh, I didn’t get that notification
I'll be on the computer in 30 minutes
at least it looks like we don’t have to change code
oh
nevermind
we don’t have admin access
:simple_smile:
yay
haha
Yes. I sent an email
I have access. But not admin. I don't think anyone at rain does
Yes
Admin access
I don't have access to the redirection plugin settings
No
It looks good
It’s our internet connection
that made it look bad
maybe wpengine network then?
on the iphone 6, I just changed wifi networks and it worked
let me train again
seems to work fine on both networks now
no, nevermind, I cleared safari data and tried again with the other network
and I get the missing images
so, with the RAIN network, broken images
Ok
On it
<http://www.campbells.com/v8/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/2015/09/hc-s1-2.png> is the image not loading
[Error] Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 500 (Internal Server Error) (pagenavi-css.css, line 0)

somehow, bootstrap-loader.js is getting:
or safari is crazy
^^^

it’s definitely a network issue
not device issue
it happened on my android once too
*not device issue
the dev could also be on a type of load balancer
but they are definitely different setups
dev and prod
I have been unable to reproduce the problem too
Is it possible to open a ticket with wpengine?
or have campbell’s do it
try cleaning the browser cache/etc on each try
Skynet would do the job correctly
unless john connor is messing around
is the minify function something we control?
the only “weird” thing I’ve seen, is the dev tool reporting a .js (bootstrap loader) with css contents
therefore my suggestion to check the minify plugin/function
good thing I’m not a developer
oh wait
:disappointed:
This is exclusive for the live site. Francisco just tested A LOT of times in 2 devices in devcsc
and there’s no problem there
I really think we should have csc-it contact wpengine
can we turn off minify?
no, in the wpengine end
they do some kind of minify and concatenation ?
I think so
they do something
to put it on the cdn
and the cdn is returning weird things
just as it sends wrongi mages
I saw it sending a .js file with css content
And I don’t think it’s something we can fix
That’s why I suggest having CSC-IT and wpengine figure it out
it’s definitely wpengine
what?
Lovely
And csc-it is the one that can fix it
:)
And look at this beauty:
<http://www.v8juice.com/meh>
Also:
<http://campbells.com/v8>
all the time? or the same cdn issue?
I see that on my android too
Let me check
tenés el iphone vos?
it does not appear on small screens
do you have an ipod or iphone 4?
we tried
it stops on the previous one
“where to buy"
Are we ditching the possibility that the CDN is returning wrong assets?
I have several screenshots of wrong cdn assets
including an image, that instead is a JS
Yes I did
I did, there were only a couple javascript things that were trying to run before jquery.ready
but still, I don’t see how that can make safari confuse files
check the file I just shared
see: <http://serverfault.com/questions/675761/how-to-fix-image-swapping-issue-in-ios-8-with-keep-alive-http-pipe-lining>
I’m on ti
*it
sent
I think he is on his way
here
or we start enabling/disabling plugins and see if something changes
thing is, it doesn’t happen on devcsc, or the campbells main site
Also, it doesn’t happen on chrome on ios
so that rules out the css breakpoint theory

I’ve been working on the chunky landing page. And the v8 image issue is still beating me
are you doing sauces changes on the v8 theme?
yeah
:simple_smile:
yay
can we merge that into production? ^^^
I’m crossing my fingers it can fix the images issue
how do we get it to prod?
we only see the bug in prod
:smile:
well, can we ask them?
will you make the PR to devcsc? or should I?
do eet
did the changes make it to prod?
haha
ok
so no
they haven’t
yes, that’s campbells
see? we get confused in separate rooms
are we really going to use one for all?


/giphy Cricket
ok


latest changes aren’t on production yet
ok
yes, the branch can be merged
I wanted someone to review first
same for parent theme
also, we need to make the dev and master branches
and set the default to dev
I don’t have access
or staging
or whatever we’ll use
in soups?
I mean
sauces

what cdn update?
:simple_smile:
ok, so my changes finally went through!
yay
/giphy YEAH!
I deserve something
like
going home
I’m going home
byes! :simple_smile:


let me point them to you
lol
I’m working
what is the issue?
ok
then yes, I guess I can
after I do <http://campbells.com|campbells.com>

instagram assets are the ones that are taking the longest to load, I guess that’s why they want to get rid of them
I asked WP Engine if they support HTTP/2
which would speed things up amazingly
but they don't
and don’t have an ETA
yeap

¿¿
I think so
yes
just for the related products on the product detail?
But it’s updating one slide only, pretty much like I updated the faq slide to include latest from the parent theme

aaaand it failed :stuck_out_tongue:

(I know that’s not The Office, I just needed an excuse)
yep
I agree
That’s why I have Frank Underwood’s ringtone in my phone
so I spoil it to everyone
Ok
NE VER
I’m not rude
I’m dulce

/giphy olakease
OK
wheee
we don’t have access to plugins in prod
/giphy DRAMA

Shoot
We _could_ change the unique URL when one clicks the title of a FAQ item
only on v8 you have to click a title to see the FAQ content
so it wouldn’t make sense on soups
you have to click on the category
not on the FAQ item title
1-2 hours
We could create a search dictionary/relationship thing in the theme settings. And then we could just inject them on search. if “salt” is present, also add “salt” related keywords into the search, behind the scenes
But it would be best if the actual faq content contained those words
for SEO purposes
google won’t find them if they don’t have it
I’ll create fields so they can enter those themselves. Maybe 3-5 hours for the implementation

just eat everything
until your body accepts it
that’s what we do here

Is it possible that they haven’t updated the latest code from devcsc?
from when I fixed that in devcsc
last week I think
no
but <https://devcsc.wpengine.com/campbells-sauces-2/brand-grill/lemon-pepper-chicken-sauce/> (open in incognito window) works
what exactly about cookies?
ok
on cache maybe, cookies just seem to be not working
looking more into it
there is one faq thing we are working
but I’m not sure yet if it will require code
ok
thanks
haha
I think not
voy!
use sublimerge to solve them
Ok
Revieweing
I’m good to merge <https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-v8-theme/pull/260>
are you good?
ok
dulce
are we hiding the WP Admin bar because it breaks design or because campbell’s doesn’t want it?
because it is useful
I miss it :disappointed:
no, but it is annoying to see a product, and go look it in the wp-admin
when you could just click “edit product” on the bar
what do you think?
that’s why I asked
I assume it broke the carousel on the home for <http://campbells.com|campbells.com>
or the menu
gg
you’re not the only one :disappointed:
haha
I’ve been cleaning code and checking the conflicts
yes, it’s completely broken, because I removed all the <http://campbells.com|campbells.com> less files
and only left the ones for v8
why?
yes
I left some variables
file
and the mixins
Ok
so I guess my question is
ok
that was my question
you answered it before I asked
¬¬
ok
I assumed all the v8 folder stuff was all we touched, and that the rest wast kept intact
kewl
instead of deactivating the slides base theme
I just switched themes
and then chose v8
and it made it recognize the parent theme
I also sent a bug fix for the parent theme
that was causing issues when changing themes

screenshot?
I did send him a dump from our staging
but
BUT
all the slides were renamed in the parent theme
or most
if I remember correctly
so yeah, I think we’ll need to rebuild stuff
yay!
oh, then no
something is wrong
you should be able to add them all
let me checks
please switch themes and switch back
I see them all
on my local
whoop
save any brand
to restore the permalinks
no, the url should contain the brand
not just /product
<https://www.campbells.com/v8/energy/raspberry-vanilla/>
like that one
let me check
ok there is an error
let me fix it
did that fix the issues you were having?
like content needed to be added back
becauses slides names were changed
so that was lost
same as in campbells 2.0
I said it, yesterday, when Matt found there was no content
ok
will do
ok
let me check
I’ll add back the infinite-product.php file
so it overrides the brand parent theme
that’s why we have overrides
it’s not as bad as it sounds
ok
^
is the actual slide also different
?
yep
we need the v8 theme enabled for <http://devcsc.wpengine.com/v8-2/>
right now only twenty sixteen and fifteen are available
kewl
haha
I just had flashbacks
with that giphy
Great thanks :)
Ok
ok
I’ll get in touch with him
We are waiting on csc-it to patch the plugin
Ok
Vool
Cool
Emily is the one pushing them for that patch
haha
ok
why do we need a new carousel.js?
as in, what are the differences?
uhmm
can it be overriden with a specific v8 .js?
so no js changes?
noyce
:tada::nail_care::dancers::dancer:
the parent theme PR failed checks
still
checking
what is busted?
Should be the same as <http://cs.com|cs.com>
omg
I should click
on the joi button
I assume you’re all gone?
ok
I’m going to start marking started/finished the stories and work on the product details
the new features
ok
will do
and <https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-brand-parent-theme/pull/266>
:open_mouth:
:scream:
I don’t think I ever did
Marisa said she was joining the scrum
I think that’s what she expected?
I usually just restart the computer
hah
NOOOOOOOO
I only have a quick change pending in the transparency wheel and it'll be done
^
wheeeee
<!channel>: I’m sick and I’ll be working from home today
ok
csc-develop-phase-2 and staging are identical
everything  has pushed to staging is on devcsc. the brand parent theme is also up to date
I only see one commit, on his personal branch, that is not on staging or devcsc
<https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-v8-theme/commit/2881dbe1a893e48ffdbdb2151089667818db3d9f>
that he hasn’t pushed
is it fish soup?
can kids eat Dory now? :stuck_out_tongue:
yay
ok
done
I assigned you the faq search thing
is anyone getting the okta code emails?
:slightly_smiling_face:
zenks
AND <https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-brand-parent-theme/pull/271>
^
Yes
Just a little
yep
:unamused:
yes
a bunch
yes
that one works great
ok
I’ll point it out now
<https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-brand-parent-theme/blob/staging/infinite-product.php#L8>
it should be the same alt for the thumbnail sizes
what happened with the 8 in the url?
`/v-funsion/`
what if I’m not fixing anything?
:stuck_out_tongue:
NOO
that’s the idea
ah
did it work on your local?
=/
well, Matt is right
what is the 800?
agree
looks ok
I don’t know :slightly_smiling_face:
I’m reading the embed.js
to check if we can figure out something
I liked Matt’s solution
of hiding the inner div
so it still flickers
then let’s go with that for now
yes
isElementVisible is not ideal if we want it to load before it’s in the viewport
iframes get a .instagram-media-rendered class
I’ll try to do something based on that
yep
<https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-v8-theme/pull/319/files#diff-e8a233058211c77f51de535cd8ebb8d6L76>
you should leave that check
otherwise everything will run again with scroll
kewl
<https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-brand-parent-theme/pull/280> needs conflicts resolved first
both
if frontend is ready
backend should
let me see
no
there is a PR by Tyler waiting to me berged
I’ll go ahead and merge it
ok

did you push directly to staging in parent theme?
ok
ups
sorry
I was having lunch
sorry
I was in a meeting
is it still on?
parent theme and v8 pushed to devcsc
no problemo
the build finished, but for some reason, it takes a while for changes to appear
Ok. Will do that
yes
bumping the version number too
one sec
ok, everything pushed now. should take a while for changes to show up
:slightly_smiling_face:

Yay
I'm assuming the language file got lost somewhere. Or the language domain was changed. I'll check after lunch
Ok
updating child themes version numbers
version numbers updated
I’m not sure what’s wrong with the labels in v8 prod
AFAIK we haven’t updated it
it works fine in devcsc, cscrain and my local
checking
i just made a new install and imported from devcsc/v8-2
and get the same issue on header and footer
now I’ll check why
<https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-v8-theme/pull/340>
the menu names/slugs have changed
there is a fix for the header
you can work on the footer one
I think it would need a new footer file for that, to override the parent theme
yes I think so
ok
sent

remove the csc-standards before running the ./check.sh
apparently, they have been updated
kewl
ok
on it
done
ok
nevermind
I did it for CK
looks like I can’t read
I don’t see any new commits
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWaLxFIVX1s>
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3u70WELSEg>
I’m just youtubing vader’s no
:stuck_out_tongue:
why is it called v8?
nope
not there
but wikipedia told me
I’m working from home tomorrow

Checking
yay for quick fixes
nay for dumb code :disappointed:
now we just wait for changes to be live
aand they’re there
no
the change was done in the v8 theme
checking
<http://devcsc.wpengine.com/campbells-sauces-2/skillet-sauces/chicken-marsala-sauce/>
^^
works correctly now
when permalinks go weird, I save a brand, which triggers the permalinks rebuild
that is, a weird way to do it
so I’ll work on having it refreshed when permalinks are saved in settings instead
did you guys finish already?
3 minutes
new record?
well, she is pretty
haha
Time for?
That will be done in a couple of hours
Yes :)
The no form is set in all sites for now. Since none has coupons. We are yet to fully test the coupons functionality because of that.
wait!
<https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-v8-theme/pull/367>
and
<https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-brand-parent-theme/pull/307>
wheeeeee
I'll just attend and be alone
Hahaha

why was my hair straight and now curly?
I can die in peace now
I’ll clone myself in hangouts
wheee
/giphy the office crying
I'd like to thank my mom
For believing in me
And lalo my parrot
Saying cat and jerk in the same sentence is an oxymoron
Looking at it now
it was closed anyways :stuck_out_tongue:
but I’m checking
it’s funny the checker didn’t complain before about those yodas
why `do_shortcode()`?
`the_sub_field()` should work for that
it should apply filters and etc
so you don’t have to
`the_sub_field` echoes by itself
so just `&lt;?php the_sub_field( 'content_area_secondary' ) ; ?&gt;`
we are using echo mostly
so we should stick to that?
haha
no
no scrum
NEVER
it is
because I ran a speed test
and we have 16mbs
16?
I don’t know
but it’s not our internet
it’s wpengine
I don’t think so, it’s not production environment, and it will probably be fixed soon
the link is wrong
<http://devcsc.wpengine.com/v8-2/> works
and seems to be loading fast now
if only instagram is taking some time
then it’s an instagram issue
Omg omg omg
url?
the hero image
seems to be too heavy
3.2mb
yes, reopen
hero image is 3.2mb
sounds like too much
^
I think we do
<http://campbells55.wpengine.com/wp-admin>
AFAIK
whee
I’m sure there are bugs caused by the parent theme
not being updated
BTW
monday is holiday in managua
there is a regenerate thumbnails plugin
I’ll run it there
ah ok
/giphy hackerman

Yeah
will there be food?
35 now?
: )
should have said something
I would have sang sapo verde tu yu
tomorrow it’s not your birthday
maybe next year

I would have to check on IE

will there be food?
I can’t chew juice
WHOOHOOOO

that’s how excited I am

that sounds like a plan
at least for me

I’m confident we can get the newsletter done this week
/giphy wooohooo

Yes

:tornado:

yes
sorry
I”M COMING
what do you mean “as brand pages”?
if they are built in the regular “Pages” section
it should be alright
I think
Or maybe we’ll need a new post type
yes, Brand pages should work







Just Wait faster




:aussie_parrot:
yes I can
to confirm, we’re merging to `csc-develop-phase2` right ?
ok
I don’t see any PRs
ok
pushed
now we just wait
my only question would be
there’s a couple of pivotal tasks about the popup appearing everywhere
was that fixed?
ok
right now I’m prioritizing swanson, but I can look at it at the end of the day, is that ok?
<https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/132017531>
and <https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/131941255>
ok
kewl
she’s checking on devcsc right?
csc-develop and staging are the same right now
so it _should_ be on devcsc
it’s <http://devcsc.wpengine.com/v8-2/> right?
<https://devcsc.wpengine.com/v8-2/wp-content/themes/pfw-wp-brand-parent-theme/scripts/main.js?ver=1.0.1>
the change is there:
maxHeight: '90%',
it’s possible
but it would mean deployments are taking way too long
oj cors
we don’t have any channel that notifies of new PRs in the parent theme
ok
sent
were we using font awesome at any time on campbells?
:smile:
it’s not popping on each page for me
cleared cache and etc?
please try it in incognito
It is includef in the previous parent theme we used
I'm wondering if there's a reason we didn't include it in ours
We are considering adding it. Any thoughts on that?
Daniel and me.
Mostly, to use the loading icons in all CTAs for ajax requests
we’d like to use a loading icon in the CTAs
it worked like that before, and now it’s gone
I assume it’s because we stopped using the campbell’s slide base theme
ok
thanks? :stuck_out_tongue: I was mostly gone
:icecream_parrot:
they are at the bottom
of all the emoticons list
sorry, I mean emoji
I have no idea when we stopped calling them emoticons
am I old?
I was always able to text :slightly_smiling_face: :kiss: :heart:
haha
&gt;=)
&gt;=(
working on the recaptcha issue
right now
I’ll make that clear
there :slightly_smiling_face:
:stuck_out_tongue:
Ok
I;ll dace
:aussie_parrot:
I know
they complete my life
OMG
it finished 1 microsecond ago
hahaha
thank the party parrot
:parrot_dad:
where?
yay!
settings
one sec
fixed
yes, Francisco was telling me about it
:wink:

hahahahha
that makes two of us
:aussie_parrot:
:parrot_dad:
:parrot_dad:
I think we should update the new coding standards before doing that
I already did for the prawn theme
They decided the new update yesterday
Very little will change
Yes
1 hour
I'm driving to the office eight now
Right
ok
I’m here
updating coding standards . . .
:open_mouth:
:omg:
ejcron
let’s say it was a chrome update that broke it
:stuck_out_tongue:
wheee
<https://preview-dev.campbellsoup.com/v8-3/> points to devcsc
<https://preview.campbells.com/v8/> is the mirror for production (campbells 55)
/giphy NOOOOOO
merging it
yes
we're waiting on jenkins to come back from the dead
so we can push everything
Yes
That info comes from the product locator API
it's not showing up on <http://campbells.com|campbells.com> either
<https://devcsc.wpengine.com/campbells-soup-2/where-to-buy/>
them updating it requires no code changes on our side
I just found an issue with broth not showing up
joining
Because we made modifications on the product locator
But they won't be anymore on any of the brand sites
There's an issue with slides having a margin on left and right
recompiling css fixes it
so I'm sending PRs with recompiled css
As in search says there's no results?
yes
full regression in swanson, sauces, soups, v8
exactly :slightly_smiling_face:
I don't remember preview url for soups and sauces
:parrot_dad:
:slightly_smiling_face:
v8 is fine
I'm looking at the bug
on the product locator
it's an issue on the code they gave us
we were, they were waiting for it for swanson
it should be on devcsc soon
and preview-dev is the same
preview isn't, they would have to push that
leave a post it
haha
I'm still working on the fix for the product locator
Maybe in ~2.5 hours
The recipes fix is already pushed to devcsc
They can pull it
/giphy kate's code
:omg:
that is right
only code is updated
no content
I'm looking at it
what is it?
can you fix it?
I haven't touched that in a long time
:omg:
:parrot_dad:
yes
I'm working on that
&gt;
?
Ok yes
It will be done soon :)
sending a push in a few minutes
ok
pushed to devcsc
so 20-30 minutes :slightly_smiling_face:
will test newsletter form and callout on v8, swanson, soups
she updated the code?
Ok
I think so
can you try same values in <http://campbells.com|campbells.com> ?
let me check
which products are discontinued?
all v8 v-fusion smoothies are discontinued?
I think that's wilkie
there's nothing there that says the product is discontinued
I sent a new one ~15 minutes ago
I'm working on the last task assigned to me
and I see 3 assigned to Matt
so I think it is possible to finish tonight
:omg:
when those pushes get there
I think we'll be done?
I'm sorry
did I click on Deliver?
I wasn't paying attention
/giphy party parrot
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
:cry:
:cry:
hahahahahahahahhaha
They have to update the recaptcha api keys with the ones they plan to use on production
The ones set are for dev. From my account.
Ok
<https://preview.campbells.com/v8/newsletter/>
ok
wp-admin-&gt;settings-&gt;email us-&gt; set a redirect thank you page
then campbells55
Ok
They should be updated
that's because it doesn't have an updated site ID
on the product locator settings
I was talking with Francisco about this just now
I think we're not clear about what the fix did
Each site ID allows the product locator display different/limited/no brands. The site ID site on preview-dev for v8, only sends information inside the V8 beverages brand (so no brand dropdown). Our fix was to support when no brand dropdown is displayed (only categories and products).
So if any site, still displays all brands, is not a code issue, it's the SITE ID not updated
Also, at least for sauces, we don't have access in campbells55/wp-admin to update the site ID
so we have to ask them to do it
^^
maybe they changed it back?
I see right now they are still using siteid=3
on <https://www.campbells.com/sauces/where-to-buy/>
I can see it in the source code
`"wilke_api":"https:\/\/www2.itemlocator.net\/spot\/api\/pagedata?siteid=3&amp;ak=0f896fd7cb4cb0031ba249&amp;callback=JSON_CALLBACK"`
they need to update the settings in WP admin
it's not a code push
2. Update email us settings and select a page for confirmation
Yes
they should at least point to the same email us page
otherwise the response is a blank page
no it doesn't, nothing is selected and that is the first option
ok, it looks like that dropdown doesn't work
I selected "connect us"
but on reload, it still displays the first option
but after submitting the email us form, it does take you to the page I saved
Yes
1. Update email us settings and select a page for confirmation on all CMS production sites. If no "thank you" page is available, then use the same "connect " page
then no thank you page selected
that's included in Yarden's email
there's a popup?
there's a modal?!
I wasn't being picky
I call it "over window"
: 3
OK, I just pushed your changes to devcsc
:disappointed:
:omg:
:scream:
github says v8 theme was updating 2 days ago
and I think I remember the changes being made in the parent theme
so parent theme it is
I just checked and everything is sent to devcsc
and the v8 theme says it was last updated 2 days ago
<https://www.amazon.com/HP-LED-Backlit-Processor-Bluetooth-Professional/dp/B0071N53EM/ref=sr_1_4?s=pc&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1478115060&amp;sr=1-4&amp;keywords=hp+mini+laptop>
you can laugh, my mom has that one :stuck_out_tongue:
it's bulky
we have one last comment from the client
I already pushed it to devcsc, and it's ready to test
"The bug fix on the email signup lightbox looks great! I quickly tested it, but after clicking “sign up now”, nothing happened. No error message, no thank you message… nada. Can someone please look into this? I tested on the actual newsletter page with no issue."
so QA is to check the form does submit now :slightly_smiling_face:
yes
test submit the register form
command + shift + R? incognito?
maybe it's cached there
one sec
yes
preview-dev is cached
please test on devcsc
I can see it
or no I can't
oh safari being safari
wait
was that on private safari?
apparently private safari would have an issue with localStorage
and it's ok because it's not supposed to support it
I'm checking what's up with safari
there's an issue with the AJAX calls
timing out
that's wpengine
or not
because it does not time out on the newsletter page
looking more into it
kewl
thanks
<https://preview-dev.campbellsoup.com/v8-3/> is working again
:thumbsup:
WHOOOOO
PR with details sento to CSC-IT
yiii
I think of a way
we store something in localStorage and sessionStorage
then, if the localStorage var is there, but sessionStorage isn't, we can interpret it, as the user visiting again
hahaha
remy gaillard!
from the documentation: "Opening a page in a new tab or window will cause a new session to be initiated".
not sure that's what we want :confused:
Yes it is
where?
a ver
looking into it
I sent a fix for that yesterday on swanson, and it was accepted
uhmmm
do the CDN changes for CK affect the rest of the sites?
ok
It works ok <http://preview.campbells.com/swanson/|preview.campbells.com/swanson/> but not on <http://campbells.com/swanson|campbells.com/swanson>
same for v8
so I'm assuming it is a CDN issue
maybe they updated the rules for all the admin-ajax.php ?
^
I'm checking
newsletters seem to work correctly
Looking at the "back to" link in the product detail page, and I think Matt is working on the popup changes
oh ok
it's on all the brand sites
seems to be a CDN issue
are we scrumming?
did you hear back from CSC-IT about the CDN and ajax?
ok
it just needs some code style fixed
<https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-brand-parent-theme/pull/526> still has some issues, in case you haven't seen it
scrum?
lel
I pushed the latest pop-up changes. Waiting for it to arrive on devcsc

can we ask her screen size?
:scream:
/giphy boom.
that worked
wait what?
was I ever in charge of that?
Sent
~20-30 minutes

jelou!
Those are instagram embed codes
Basically we copy/pasted them without the &lt;script&gt; part, to allow our lazy loading

it's loading for me

well yes!

:icecream_parrot:
too late
I already have a google sheet with errors
haha
I’ll print it, and fedex it to you
hahaha
yes, choosing a color for each product would require a bit of backend dev
to add that field
not too much though
~2 hours
am I crazy to think that having the overlay with related colors wouldn’t be ugly?
That repo looks right
Yes
He’s the one to set up our side of the deployment




yep
I thought I added  and  to the projects I could
can you please double check? (on incognito window)
ok
dev site
I just tried adding Daniel and Matt to well-yes
you guys should have received an invite email
you have to click on the confirm link
yes
:omg:
we need CSC-IT to enable the well yes theme on devcsc/well-yes
currently, it is not available to be used in the wp admin
thanks
I saw soups was enabled
~30 minutes ago
maybe it isn't selected yet
looking into it
I don't see well yes theme enabled
I still see the soups theme enabled
<https://devcsc.wpengine.com/well-yes/wp-admin/themes.php>
wait
yes something is up
I'm trying to send a new push to devcsc
there's changes from october 1 that have not been sent
so I guess that's pretty much all of the updates
*21
no idea either
PR sent
so ~20 minutes
let's wait
aaand 
----------------
Campbells-WellYes-CSC failed
ok, thank you
yes
thank you
it says well yes
and looks based on swanson
so yes, everything looks right
so we don't have any products or recipes with well yes yet. so we won't be adding any products/recipes slides to the pages we build
yes
anything that contains products
ok, thank you
Ok
Ok
whooooo



:parrot_dad:
what do you mean "fly out"? floating?
oh ok
are we basing that from V8?
I think that's the closest we have?
please download the latest from the well yes repo
does pivotal have a template thing? so we can set those up in next projects easily
or we just document them then
Ok
I'll work on that
No. I understand that it's a rule we're not supposed to do any changes at all. So we will try to make modifications we need via filters on the child theme ( if needed ).
Ok
no!
ok
we're waiting on  to update the SSL certificate so github + jenkins starts working again
:scream:
:omg:
/giphy wheeeee eagle
that's correct
we don't have product images yet
yes
but we don't have any yet I think
:smile:
ejcron
ex chrome
WHOOOOOO
yeah
why?
thanks!
there's a redirect
I'm removing it
ok
it should be <https://devcsc.wpengine.com/well-yes/faqs/>
faq points to a post type, and that's why it redirects to home
wait 10 seconds and then do? :stuck_out_tongue:
who's Ronaldo?
:parrot_dad:
<!here|@here> I'll be out of office for ~1.5 hours but online if you need me
NOOO
now is fine
the sooner the better
backend isn't likely to change much
Yes, we've been using /faqs on all the brand pages because the faqs post type uses "faq"
ok
so we need to pull
can we pull the latest to csc-develop via jenkins? or should I do it in the terminal?
do we have a design for the "thank you" page after the connect form is submitted?
or should we just create something?
yes, because we didn't create one
it has one in soups
let me try create it right now
<https://devcsc.wpengine.com/well-yes/thank-you/>
^^ issue is font is white, maybe add a background?
should the font be white on the "clean" hero type?
could we default the font color to black if there's no background chosen?
just wondering what would happen if the client later wants to add the hero somewhere
they would get that same result
specific style for the thank you page sounds good
but we should make sure that adding a clean hero without background works everywhere
none
there's only 8 products :slightly_smiling_face:
let me look at the faqs
<http://devcsc.wpengine.com/well-yes/?s=soup>
2 pages
nice
please add a pivotal to remove brands from search results
oh greta
*great
thanks
yes we should
we will
wheee!
<!here|@here> I broke the products permalinks, working on it
:smile: :smile: :smile:
<!here|@here> products permalinks fixed
2 rejected tasks, and 3 pending. 7 tasks pending review by QA
:fastparrot:
No. It's set on our end, but apparently not on theirs.
We'll follow up with channel iq
we also need the website tag for the email us plugin
yep
do you have an email address also?
I can't see the one set in production
Ok :)
Yes that right

should we be pushing anything to devcsci while they test?
also
I just noticed this image has a gray line: <https://devcsc.wpengine.com/well-yes/wp-content/themes/pfw-wp-well-yes-theme-1/img/bg-products-col-2.png>
LEL
I see all the changes in bitbucket
can you get in touch?
with csc-it
wheeeee
when their jenkins fails, we usually get an email, so I'm not sure
<!here|@here>
did anyone receive an email from jenkins?
we'll send a dummy push
why?
I hadn't pushed to devcsc yet
I just did :slightly_smiling_face:
ah
cache maybe?
:disappointed:
OMG
nope they're not
yep. their jenkins seems to be down
We are
dax is working on two items left
about tags for SEO
those would be the last
ok
I'll work on that today

wgii
that meant whoo
I'll review it
I'm trying to figure how this affects the brand sites
it cuts off on my swanson local
I rather do that
while we could try and fix it, it would mean a change to the cutover plan, and QA on all the brand sites
Ok
thanks
yep
wheee
thanks
:eyes:
where did we land with the provider for that?
I think so
WHOOOO
are you using preview-dev to see them?
should we try the regenerate thumbnail plugin?
and regenerate them all
ok
running it
ok
try now
let me see
something like that
I'm fixing it
^
pushing it to devcsc
it finished already, it's on the way to devcsc now
and you have 1gb right?
5 seconds on my computer
I have 10mb
Not yet
do you have access to CSC-IT jenkins?
or do you mean our jenkins?
ok, we're sending one now
and I can see it in their dev branch in bitbucket
so our jenkins is working
can you please confirm with them?
whee
I'm the yellow one :slightly_smiling_face:
see? yellow
what else is news?
of course, we made it *SECURE* :stuck_out_tongue:
ok
they have to set that up
it's on the cutover plan
we don't have access
OR
it looks like we do have access
I'll do it now
done
are you checking mobile?
wheee
I think Matt already fixed that in devcsc
WHOOO
:fastparrot:
OK
unless
I'll be around on thursday
sing
:open_mouth:
:parrot_dad:
no
it's perfect
trust me.
:stuck_out_tongue:
We are
We can't push to the parent theme but we can push to the well yes theme
I'm creating a PR for devcsc
It's taking ~5 seconds per page in my computer
:smile:
that's us
the change is pushed to devcsc
they would have to push the theme to production
that's on the cutover plan
I think that's what they did
but now our well yes specific fix is creating issues
if that's the only difference we have, as in, no other dom elements for well yes, then yes
it's best to just delete the file
there's also some style removal there, is that ok?

Ok
I think the classifieds plugin will be doable
I mean, it won’t be a challenge at all
I think it’s meant for private selling only.  ?
I think they are manually creating them after they’re sold
?
Tyler do you mean add or listing?
Yes, probably integrate with the local bank BAC, for the payment gateway
I’ve done that before
yeah, that’s what I said
“electronic POS” = payment gateway
I know
that’s why I explained they are the same
yeah, I understood Tyler was talking about actual ads within the website, from companies
casa pellas will probably place theirs
That will be hard to keep track of. In amazon, they can certify the user actually bought the product
So anyone could leave a good or bad rating, just because
Or someone can just ask his entire family to leave good reviews
that doesn’t fix it
what you suggest is just an “rate me” invite
you still don’t know if I bought a car from X reseller
sounds like work for the reseller, but doable, and they’ll want to be able to get reviews
don’t they mean their own cars?
Maybe they can edit another user’s car profile, and save them into their own?
yes










































































































we usually export the code
and include it in the functions.php
and haven’t had any problems
are you exporting xml and then importing?
oh never mind, it’s not when exporting, it’s when saving a new field group
what version is it?
we use the version from <https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-plugins>
<https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-plugins/tree/develop/advanced-custom-fields-pro>


haha
what about rating and # of reviews?
oohhh
I’ll have to look closer then
thanks
I see it now
59 out of 100 have reviews
from 100 I looked at

OH SO THATS IT
oops
caps
:simple_smile:
ajúa







finally I know



they should be separate endpoints
i.e:
`GET /products/:moa_id`
`GET /products/?ids=123,123,123`
then `GET /products/?ids=123` should return an array with a single item
make sure to check <http://www.vinaysahni.com/best-practices-for-a-pragmatic-restful-api>
its a really good guide for restful api design
:smile:
and they are missing user rating too
because they are already stored in the DB
also
recipes images URL are: <http://www.cscassets.com/recipes/large_cknew/large_{RECIPE_ID}.jpg|www.cscassets.com/recipes/large_cknew/large_{RECIPE_ID}.jpg>
I saw 3 variations of url
one for large, “larger”, and small
cool
how likely is the image url to chage?
since all sizes have the same structure
How does it find the closest size available?
Are you displaying a lot of different image sizes all over the app?

haha
boo
haha
ok
Tag management tool = categories order?
I worked on that. If you need changes we can talk about it
^^
No. The recipe categories from the API
Ok
IM

They weren’t there yesterday I checked
please add both  and me on any bugs or new features needed for the CMS
Ok
Yes, we did talk about it
Yes
will work on it
and I’ll help out
I did changes on the Homepage CMS, and the JSON, I’ll work with  on it
but there are some differences that will need to be considered on the mobile app
is taking care of it
“D
:smile:
Ok
I still think its weird we are using + as separator
and or   just finished converting the ck-cms theme to a plugin: <https://github.com/mediarain/ck-cms/pull/6> . Which means we now need to deploy to the `plugins` folder instead of `themes`.
Ok

I think he means find a way to cache it within the gateway
I think  mentioned me that solr could cache it, so it doesn’t take that long to respond

what endpoint are you talking about? so I can take a look
The CMS was converted to a plugin now, instead of a theme. It should be all set. We are missing recipes images, from photon.
I saw them on the services-dev api yesterday
not sure if  needs to do something to include them on the gateway
From their email, I think the images will slowly start appearing on the recipes
not all at once
does it cache if it returns an error?
noyce


ok
yes
you need to enter that content into the CMS
Will do!
about some recipes not being there?
I’ll run an import now
they are already grouped
`Others` is an array with 2 arrays
the import finish
can you check the recipes you need are there?
not yet
later tonight
Is that endpoint needed for that build? If so, I can pause what I’m working on right now to do that
should not take long
<!here|@here> ?
^^^

I just finished the support for specific ids in the recipes collections endpoint
So whenever  or  have time to add it to the gateway, go ahead :simple_smile:
Nothing new on my end
Ok
One sec
please check your email
I’ll take a look at the special chars issue
For collections, the featured image should be the image from the first recipe
I can include it in the API, if it’s easier for you
Ok
I’ll add it
Today: I’m working on the featured image for the collections, and fixing the unwanted characters
I could build an endpoint to return a random recipe.
`<http://cscrain:de7b2d04@cscrain.staging.wpengine.com/ck-cms/wp-json/ck-api/v1/recipes/random/>` returns a random recipe on each call
I don't think so
Yesterday: Fixed html entities from recipes. Included featured image in collections. Implemented new random recipe endpoint.
Today: Adding limit parameter to the random recipe endpoint, fix orderby rand
<!here|@here>: The random recipe endpoint will not be available today. WP Engine (where the cms API is hosted) does not allow orderby `rand`
and a workaround would need to be in place
right now it is returning the same recipe each time
the workaround will take some effort, since it’s not ideal. I’ll talk with Steven about it
random recipe
yes
haha

Today: Working with Steven on moving ck-cms to production, so we can have orderby RAND
led zeppelin?
Shouldn’t the API return them in order of priority according to the search?
/giphy radio
like
walking and moving?
can anyone touch his forehead? check if he has a fever
<https://ck-app.rain.agency/> is still the ck-cms plugin or the theme with the API endpoints?


The endpoint is created, but we need to enable `orderby: rand` on their production environment. I understand they were almost done with setting the new environment up.  ?

mon-day?

so THAT’S what he meant when he said “christian will have work in the morning” last night
haha
it was never broken
it’s all in your head
:ghost:
they were too busy fixing
Ok
“in reasonable time"
haha
we are waiting on CSC-IT to upgrade a plugin



<http://cscrain.staging.wpengine.com/ck-cms/wp-admin/>
ok
not yet, I’m looking at something for the CK site right now, will do in ~20 minutes
I just updated the title on that collection
for some reason, it had the &amp;amp; added
it should work for now, but I’m looking into why that happens
Probably cache




do you want my headset?
or just yell
so another mic picks up your voice
cheking
it’s fixed now
WP’s kses would sanitize the post title
I activated the `Unfiltered MU` plugin
I think the issue is he’s changing content, but the api gateway is not returning the latest, because cache
?
so yeah, must be cache
maybe csc-it set their cache expire to longer time
:disappointed:

chrome user agent changer
haha
“letters need to stand out more when they have a background image"
fonts need a shadow or border
for same color background
?
¿
I can
where is the list?
zenks
done. changes should appear when the cache expires :slightly_smiling_face:



















I think you copied it without clicking save. It provides a default key but it’s not actually saved. I’ll add some instructions text to clarify that.












<https://devcsc.wpengine.com/ck-cms/wp-admin/post.php?post=4137&amp;action=edit>
but I don’t see the &amp;amp;
I’ll resave anyway
done
can you retry that?
I’m looking at the response from <http://devcsc.wpengine.com/ck-cms/wp-json/ck-api/v1/recipe-collections/> and it does not include the &amp;amp;
maybe I’m not looking at the right place
ok
I can see it now in the production env
try now please






I’m checking
ok
that endpoint is not on the WP





































































































































































Yay? :p
You can
And you can show us the streets
WHOHOO

this is scary
Mario was added
what if I didn’t want my mom to know?
thanks
Mostly, the tech doc includes the fields the slide/module/feature should have. So we need that in the story
The differences are minimal, so we should keep it as a single, customizable grid
that sounds nice
:nail_care:
we heard
that’s really cool
hahahaha
no need, we’ll ask yuliya to make one
:stuck_out_tongue:
but you must bring bagels
:smile:
whohooo




I recommend you bring one of those:

that’s not related
that’s just a fact
haha
we have your Rolters ready Emily
<http://www.losnicasdistributors.com/images/products/otros/chinela%20rolter.jpg>
just yours are red
?
what errors are you getting?
I’m pulling latest to try
what isn’t working?
can you send me a screenshot and point me at what is not working correctly?
please check your php error log file
you should see there what’s missing
ok
:thumbsup:
Not yet. I only pulled the latest at that moment, to see what was going on
If its for breaking php with html, then I like colons bette
r
otherwise, we should use brackets, it helps in readibility
<http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/#5-1-if-elseif-else>
I don’t think the WP VIP codestyle enforces it, because it’s pretty common to use te colons in the wp loops

the rules from jekins are different from the ones that run locally
my local jscs asked me to include those spaces
and jenkins report them as errors
^
the ones from the repo? I just did npm install, and then ran ..check.sh
$ node -v
v4.2.3
=/
$ jscs -V
2.7.0
could be
I assume npm install just installed the latest
but I’m not getting that issue on the other campbells repos
is the node version independent on each repo?
I think maybe there has been an update in the airbnb preset
maybe the add those spaces now
and that’s why only my local wants me to add them
it’s this one: <https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-campbells-kitchen-theme/pull/46>
ok
thankyou!

let me update the .editorconfig for that one
do you mind if I play with your branch?
did you install the .editorconfig plugin on your sublime text?
ok
there you go: <https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-campbells-kitchen-theme/pull/67>
<!here|@here>: <https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-campbells-kitchen-theme/pull/68>
Also everyone, please disable the ck-cms plugin, if you have it enabled.
and install the plugins from these 2 PR instead:
<https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-plugins/pull/7>
<https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-plugins/pull/6>
DO NOT MERGE THOSE PR
just download the files to your `wp-content/plugins`

New CK plugins (install them on your local installs):
<https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-plugins/pull/7>
<https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-plugins/pull/6>
(DONT MERGE THOSEP RS)
It should not need the `Template` bit at all. It's not a child theme
Let me take it off on my local just to make sure
Ok
Looking at it now
also, anyone?
<https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-campbells-kitchen-theme/pull/68>

unplug your earphones

wheee
we should integrate pivotal too
WHEE
ok
Ok
We can!
:smile:
We are very positive
from the cms
from the common fields
it’s adding them because someone added them
probably
yes
edit the page, go to the slide, click on “common fields"
yup
it’s insane
it’s 95 but feels like 120 with the humidity
after I finish the last recipe grid today, maybe we can work on the frontend a bit? when first loading, all the images appear huge, and only get their size when the grid JS is ran
so it’s not nice at all
which PR?
:slightly_smiling_face:
ok
kewl
I understood we will only use that big header on the homepage and nowhere else
if that’s the case, we don’t need a custom field for that
we don’t have that field in CK
I think
let me double double check
oh nevermind
we do
main logo, main logo mobile, alternate logo
lel
<https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-campbells-kitchen-theme/pull/86>
is your PR ready?
noyce
me too
i’m going in
haha
WHAT?
sound AND video?
that may be the reason then
haha

That would be good
If  you’re QA that, we should start building the pages
And I guess you will need that :smile:
Wheeee
Yes, we need to start building the pages
and removing the `page-something.php` files
Github is slow today
We have a small number of slides left for the article page, collections grid is coming today. I think we’re in a good place, and we’ll be able to start building all the pages oson
They’ll be published by the client

you broke github
well done
not me!
:disappointed:
I did
yes
oh yeah, that’s how it works
but that’s frontend
I think it only counts items
(nevermind what I said)
Yes
jenkins is still down :disappointed:
on articles?
there should be a table slide
oh ok
then I need to
and we have to talk to CSC-IT about it
yes
I can add it for now
We have selected it, we just have to figure out if we’ll include it in the theme, or have CSC-IT add it to the plugins repo
I pinged Steven about it
The table plugin is now installed
You can test the article table slide
who are they assigned to?
I think is the post title
and Intro is an excerpt from the post content
yes
one sec
it’s the “single” view for a collection
like: <http://cscrain.staging.wpengine.com/campbells-kitchen/collection/test-collection/>
and <http://cscrain.staging.wpengine.com/campbells-kitchen/collection/emilys-collection/>
they are created/edited at: <http://cscrain.staging.wpengine.com/campbells-kitchen/wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=recipe-collection>
<https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-campbells-kitchen-theme/pull/109>
Jenkins doesn’t know it exists
but it does not appear on github then
we used “please try again” yesterday and it worked
I just tried “retry” and it does not show up in github
there’s usually a notification on the PR’s, that all tests passed
that is not happening
```

thanks :smile:
and the backend is not finished for that :slightly_smiling_face:
if the field is empty, just leave it empty
and we should talk to them about that
so there you have
35 minutes
haha
you sum them all
that is it
if content is missing from a field, it’s because the API didn’t provide it
it’s the same
just one nice way to see it
and the WP default way to see it
(the custom field)
yep
I just everything to devcsc :slightly_smiling_face:


Yep. They updated the acf plugin and something went wrong
are you joining scrum today?
it is
wheee
did they mention what was wrong?
Ok
`post`
for the articles, there is a table slide
Ok, one sec
<https://projects.invisionapp.com/d/main#/console/6632348/142307033/preview>
^^
yes, we are using it on cscrain and our local installs
Apparently. They updated to `0.9.4.30` over a month ago

Cool!

are those items on the 404 the same that appear on the search?
<https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-campbells-kitchen-theme/pull/171/files#diff-571d8511e9a5932f61747ae0d4760c14R17>
Aren’t categories only coming from the API?
There should be a chicken term in the Main Ingredient taxonomy
we are not suposed to create pages for them
we just add the collections
when editing one
you edit the existing chicken categegory
and add the collections
it’s not a page builder
you just add the collections
yes
that looks like a bug
:slightly_smiling_face:
yes
lel
`Please try again tomorrow`

haha
OMG OMG OMG
wheee
I asked that
haha
as in version 17? :stuck_out_tongue:
it is
not sure if it’s the internet connection here
as usual :slightly_smiling_face:
Right now, it shows them all, and only paginates results after you have filtered
So, let us know if that’s ok, or if it should always paginate
and etc
:smile: :smile: :smile:
it does not load them from the api
they are stored in WP
and the images are loaded from their CDN
it will just load more
so yes, it would take longer, to load all the images
but that’s the browser
doing the work
but yes
you make sense
I’ll add the load more
ticket please
pretty please
with sugar on top
boom

so the grid pattern
repeats itself

not me
not you
guess who!
:stuck_out_tongue:
it’s when the items are still drafts
:smile: :smile: :smile:
wheee
let me see what’s up
I don’t see any problems with the response from WP
<http://devcsc.wpengine.com/ck-cms/wp-json/ck-api/v1/categories-order/>
it loaded to me
and ck-cms is separate from campbells-kitche-2
I don’t see it in the installed plugin list in devcsc
and they haven’t applied the piklist patch either
wheee
zenkiu
never change
haha
yes
each square

Ok
in any case
it should be around 10

is `/kitchen-guide/tips` a page?
that’s why then
it links back to the topic
as in taxonomy =&gt; term

<!channel>: I’m sick and I’ll be working from home today
:slightly_smiling_face:
k.o

/giphy go into the water
ok
yep
:open_mouth:
:scream:

Much better now :)
It does not help with bronchitis :(
there is some work we can still do with sprinklr
x
I’m coordinating with Daccs
Ducks
Dax!
:stuck_out_tongue:
all products (recipes) are supposed to be imported to sprinklr before we can leave reviews on them
are we doing that?
ok
that will do
as in, clone them
my english sucks :slightly_smiling_face: I said that I was working with one recipe/product to try reviews, and that I think it is the only recipe stored in sprinklr
ok
one sec
<https://services.campbellsoup.com/Recipes/recipe/26795>
me to
o
yep
that is :slightly_smiling_face:
you missed it
most awesome scrum ever

WHAT???
and I’m thin
haha
did you change your okta password?
don’t believe him
that’s a photoshop
hahahaha
I will check
Zebks
Zenks
<https://builds.mediarain.com:8443/job/Campbells-Kitchen-Theme-PR/387/console>
can we retry that build?
please
^^
so yes
we have piklist and table field plugin
:slightly_smiling_face:
too late, I just finished the slides
quick question
:smile:
so
in the recipedetail
and user profile
there is a see more button
right now, it just displays some hidden ones
so question is:
how many “per page”/per load should it load?
yes
that makes sense
so, second question:
yes please
on both
just to have it clear
ues
yes
also to be clear:
right now, the load more just display more reviews that were already loaded, but hidden
is that the intended functionality?
or should it load them via ajax first, and then show them?
ok
so we can initially load 5
but display only 1
first click on button displays the other 4
more clicks, ajax load mrore reviews
:)))
zenks
There isn't one. And that will have to do until we have full gigya integration and we can create multiple users.
I’ll push now
we haven’t in a while
please remove your csc-standards folder
next time you run the ./check.sh
the standards changed a bit




We have exported what we have from cscrain for now
You can try exporting from devcsc
See if it passes
Rain export
nope
we can
ok
merging it
I think they are off today
well, Emily is online
?
/giphy Friday!
boom
frito friday
&lt;div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Recipe"&gt;
nice
:open_mouth:
yes!!
yay
updates sent to devcsc
Ok
I'll be back on the computer in 14 minutes
I'll check it
ok, took longer than 15 mins
but checking now
looks good, only question is
why use two filters for the same tag?
the `defer` could be added in the first one
also, we don’t need a foreach there if we only have one value in the `$scripts_to_async` var
we could just do
`if ( ‘pinterest-init’ === $handle )`
^^
If you see that happening. The yeah. It's good to have them separate
Then*
Haha
Ok
I was going to say that it is possible. We do get weird needs like the on viewport thing for Instagram.
Sounds like a plan
merged  :smile:
wheeee

ok
will test them :smile:


Mic not working :)
I tried to add reviews yesterday and they are not showing up yet
But I’ve seem some in others
yeah
looks like we don’t have anymore
:smile:
I found one that has
but it’s not in cscrain
I’m importing all the recipes to cscrain
zenkiu



we are
yes, we are
onLogout, daniel’s code removes the session cookie
however, if somebody stored it
they could reuse it, IF we skip their auth
nevermind
we are not doing that anyways
it was just one my case scenarios if we were to use the master/account key, and ignore the timestamp
yes we are
we store it in a cookie
that’s what we are doing
but we still have the 60 seconds limit
we are using <http://developers.gigya.com/display/GD/accounts.exchangeUIDSignature+REST>
that’s nice
the unit testing is supposed to be deleting de product
but apparently, the reviews stay there
:slightly_smiling_face:
yeah, their API docs state that the delete review endpoint is not really implemented
so it makes sense that deleting a product does not delete a review
I think  mis understood that there are 11 reviews on a single recipes
but there’s really 11 reviews total, in different products/recipes
yep
it still has the hardcoded user id in there
I’m writing setup steps for the `rain-reviews` plugin, I’ll be done in ~15 minutes
the plugin has now a decent README and is updated with the latest craziness
Yes. The 60 seconds expiration of the signature timestamp
No
Because it returns false before checking everything else
I do. But it doesn't mean it's valid but expired. It means it didn't check at all because the timestamp is too old
Yes
That specific pseudo code is from their docs
But the php sdk does the same
Can we confirm with them that the response says it's expired but valid?
Thanks
^
for the item list API
we are getting a credentials error
good news
is that it’s happening on their environment too
<https://campbellswpdemo.captechventures.com/recipe/southern-style-chicken-barbecue-slaw-sandwiches/>
`ItemListApiCollection.fetch().done().fail()`
yes
we’re starting to integrate it the ck theme
but we can’t test
because it’s not working
I’m not sure if the API key we have is incorrect
but it’s returning an auth error
I'm online :)
is <https://campbellswpdemo.captechventures.com/> loading for you?
I’m not in the office, so that may be why =/
so the theme repo in our github was updated 7 days ago
I don’t have rain vpn
I’m talking with Nathan about getting in the VPN
So we need to set a kind of middleware for jQuery.ajax()
I’ll look into it
checking it
can you share the email please?
stop spamming co workers about cats
:stuck_out_tongue:
I did get your email
thanks
I can see that captech’s demo is working now
cool
do we know if their plugin and theme download urls contain the latest?
or should we git pull from their repos?
our repo was last updated 7 days ago
ok
on it
^
Ok
Thanks
exporting directly to the wordpress XML would be better
yep
that’s a good question
guid should be the slug
let me try that
:)
so I’m dumb and haven’t finished the part that when you log in/ sign up with gigya, it creates the user in sprinklr
I’m working on that
ok
sounds good
I don’t think they meant they touched our env
they meant they uploaded API changes on the item list
api
ha
drow
I’m also direct emailing with Duy
about it
it is about their API
changes
:slightly_smiling_face:
ok
update is, both the API and plugin had bugs, the API is fine now, but we will get an updated version of the plugin
I'll try it :)
hi
Yes, I was having lunch
1. What is the URL of the WordPress site this is data is being imported?
This is used when you want yo import the media. We won’t be doing that here, so you can either use a localhost, or the current live site <http://www.campbellskitchen.com/>
2. How can I build the `guid`?
The Guid is the sanitized title (`-` instead of spaces, no other weird characters)
3. I assume I generate my own post IDs? The only IDs I have from SiteCore are UUIDs.
Yes. You can have them all start with 1000 + your id.
4. Are any metadata fields optional?
Almost all of the metadata fields are optional. 
5. Can I get an explanation of each of the metadata fields and their respective values?
Basically, all the `----field——` in the sitecore file can/will become meta fields. 
For each recipe that is part of that collection, it will become a 
```
```
&lt;wp:postmeta&gt;
			&lt;wp:meta_key&gt;&lt;![CDATA[recipes_0_recipe]]&gt;&lt;/wp:meta_key&gt;
			&lt;wp:meta_value&gt;&lt;![CDATA[3843]]&gt;&lt;/wp:meta_value&gt;
		&lt;/wp:postmeta&gt;
		&lt;wp:postmeta&gt;
			&lt;wp:meta_key&gt;&lt;![CDATA[_recipes_0_recipe]]&gt;&lt;/wp:meta_key&gt;
			&lt;wp:meta_value&gt;&lt;![CDATA[field_570ad0ce9489d]]&gt;&lt;/wp:meta_value&gt;
		&lt;/wp:postmeta&gt;```
where 3943 is the ID of the recipe
`field_570ad0ce9489d` should be the same in all of them
you’re right, on the export it becomes that url.
you only have to replace the `1358` with the post id for the recipe
Yes, it can be different after content imports, which probably happened here. But you can use the same post_id here
ok. I’ve checked our code and we won’t have any issues with their update. We are not providing a pre-set id for reviews, so we won’t need any changes on our side.
ok, we will
please share the info :slightly_smiling_face:
ok
thanks
I was wondering why nothing happened :slightly_smiling_face:
I’ll test that new file, thank you.
I think we are expecting the ~1200 collections
^
those are nested categories
that would be a question for
`draft` would work better
I think we can white list them ourselves
for daniel
yes
added
I think those should be wordpress taxonomies=&gt;terms instead of empty collections
they look almost the same as recipe's
thanks
we are looking pretty good
the only issue the mention is a quick fix
now let’s see what QA comes with
:unamused:
hahahaha
I say that and there’s a ticket from francisco
Yes. I'm also giving time to QA to test reviews before sending them another pass.
```&lt;wp:postmeta&gt;
  &lt;wp:meta_key&gt;&lt;![CDATA[recipe_category_set_1_taxonomy]]&gt;&lt;/wp:meta_key&gt;
  &lt;wp:meta_value&gt;&lt;![CDATA[Occasion]]&gt;&lt;/wp:meta_value&gt;
&lt;/wp:postmeta&gt;
&lt;wp:postmeta&gt;
  &lt;wp:meta_key&gt;&lt;![CDATA[_recipe_category_set_1_taxonomy]]&gt;&lt;/wp:meta_key&gt;
  &lt;wp:meta_value&gt;&lt;![CDATA[field_56e19d7d08739]]&gt;&lt;/wp:meta_value&gt;
&lt;/wp:postmeta&gt;
&lt;wp:postmeta&gt;
  &lt;wp:meta_key&gt;&lt;![CDATA[recipe_category_set_1_terms]]&gt;&lt;/wp:meta_key&gt;
  &lt;wp:meta_value&gt;&lt;![CDATA[a:1:{i:0;s:2:"13";}]]&gt;&lt;/wp:meta_value&gt;
&lt;/wp:postmeta&gt;
&lt;wp:postmeta&gt;
  &lt;wp:meta_key&gt;&lt;![CDATA[_recipe_category_set_1_terms]]&gt;&lt;/wp:meta_key&gt;
  &lt;wp:meta_value&gt;&lt;![CDATA[field_56ec23dd2a40b]]&gt;&lt;/wp:meta_value&gt;
&lt;/wp:postmeta&gt;```
Each Taxonomy/Term set would require those 4 blocks
first one indicates the taxonomy `Occasion`
second block, the custom field id `field_56e19d7d08739` (which should stay the same)
third block is a serialized array for the value `13`
13 would be the term ID
I think we need two lists. One for each term =&gt; term_id, and one for each recipe_id =&gt; post_id
I understand you need to be able to map the term name to the term id in WP. So I could make a json with that. Same for recipes. You have the recipe_id that is the same on the CK API. But It does not directly translate to the WP post id for the recipe. So you would need that too
on it
we can’t test leaving reviews if we can’t login :disappointed:
:tornado:
/giphy wingardium leviosa
Would it work for you to have an endpoint in CK to get each recipe post ID? i.e: `<http://campbells.dev/recipes/wp-json/ck-api/v1/recipes/ids/12345>` would return the `post_id` for the recipe id `12345`. Problem is that post ids may vary from WP installs. (my local, vs cscrian, vs devcsc). We probably want to use the devcsc one. But we don’t have DB access there, and returning them all at once would not work, cause of memory limits for the PHP process.
I’d create a similar endpoint for the terms
Same issue
for every term you’ll be exporting, do you also have the taxonomy? So the endpoint can be `/terms/Cuisine/African` and it would return the `term_id`.
/giphy <#C0W9021BR|echo> :(
I use campbells.dev
I tried adding them, but it doesn’t recognize it as valid domains, so it didn’t let me
ah
nice
<http://cscrain.staging.wpengine.com/campbells-kitchen/> does not work for me
<http://cscrain.staging.wpengine.com/campbells-kitchen/> is working, for now :slightly_smiling_face:
^
nevermind
it’s not working now
oh well
we should get breakdance lessons from  while we wait
I have VPN
i’ll try it now
campbells.dev works on mine now
also cscrain
via VPN
<https://www.expressvpn.com/vpn-software/vpn-mac>
just pay
$$$
it seems to work for me at campbells.dev and cscrain
/giphy wheeee evil
now everyone is on US netflix -.-
haha
they need to get approved
is the okta password changed?
oh
it still works
it’s just daniel being *CRAZY*
/giphy <#C0W9021BR|echo> CRAZY
<http://devcsc.wpengine.com/campbells-kitchen-2/wp-json/ck-api/v1/terms/ids/Chicken>
and
<http://devcsc.wpengine.com/campbells-kitchen-2/wp-json/ck-api/v1/recipes/ids/26663>
X-API-KEY header should be `379f83621fc4b0aefa70c4b07cafdf84080f3c5e`
`Chicken` would be the term. It should also work with terms like `Pancakes/Waffles/French Toast`
`26663` is the `recipe-id`. It will return the whole WP post object
I get `[{"term_id":37,"name":"Chicken","slug":"chicken","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":37,"taxonomy":"Main-Ingredient","description":"","parent":0,"count":388,"filter":"raw”}]` from that URL
can you try using X-API-KEY (uppercase)
?
can you download it and use it from our site?
I’d try downloading it
and using it from devcsc
working on it
do you have an specific request that is failing?
it did
die
:slightly_smiling_face:
looks like we killed <http://devcsc.wpengine.com/campbells-kitchen-2/> with traffic?
sprinklr made another change to the API
unrelated to the email they sent
and it broke reviews, again
yes
They changed the `rating` property on the reviews, to only have `value`. They required `min` and `max` before, now those properties are gone.
Instead of ignoring the other values, it just fails.
ok
reviews are working again
yes
add reviews
tons of them
and let me know so I can approve them
yes
create account
leave review
log out
repeat
it’s a staging server, it’s not expected to have much power.
but yes, 5 requests per second sounds bad
I’ll try it later
I think we should set a default before
maybe 4?
:slightly_smiling_face:
The issue is that a default should be pre-set
instead of empty
yes
I don’t see your reviews
what name did you use?

hit refresh
it will ignore the ones already imported
that’s a very good question
can that form be a screenset somehow?
I’m checking the REST api
Well, they still need to be logged in
otherwise, I could subscribe anyone to it
can we make it just a fake subscribe form? user clicks “subsribe” and we load a screenset for login / signup
maybe a shorter one
does that make sense?
`accounts.isAvailableLoginID` checks if the email address already exists in the DB
we can use that
for your idea
I think we can, that’s what Daniel has been doing for the profile page
yes
we could leave the email field, pre-populated, for clarity
even if they can’t change it
I just got in
I think the issue is that the post IDs are not the same in cscrain as devcsc
and there’s also  a chance that cscrain doesn’t have all recipes
I’m checking
:thumbsup:
cscrain seems to have all available recipes. Problem seems to be that the post IDs for devcsc and cscrain are not the same, you would have to build your export file with the API responses from cscrain.
API KEY: 624720c071d152ee1e523425cef99782b95ecc1f
<http://cscrain.staging.wpengine.com/campbells-kitchen/wp-json/ck-api/v1/terms/ids/Chicken>
can you show me the failure messages?
we are making progress with the item list
like
progress we celebrated
and danced
:slightly_smiling_face:
I assume you delete all collections before importing again?
can you send me the latest export file so I can test it?
thanks
and it’s the same button, but repeated, right?
ejcrom
I’m leaving it with a default of 4 stars
and they can change it if they want
does that make sense  ?
That's how it works right now
So we need to add an error saying "you have to choose at least one star"
the issue with the failed collections is that some bits of the dates have one digit only
The issue is in the second sample
I think the first one still works
You're welcome
nope
the issue is that only the last one loads the saved values
they are not failing anymore
:slightly_smiling_face:
haha
Taxonomy for?
None
Don't select any so it imports them all
Ehm
Collections are to be imported with an xml file
Robert posted it here on friday
WordPress import
Yes
It should work with the current one
yes. there are a few bug fixes right now, I’m finishing the last one this morning (up/down vote)
You need to activate all the plugins that are active on cscrain
Yes, I’ll send it to you
check your email
I'll take a lool
yes, I’ll submit PR in ~1 hour
BTW  the up vote/down vote sprinklr api endpoint is not working
:slightly_smiling_face:
Yes
one sec
why is libs and main modified?
I needed to update some css for the form validation, almost done now
I fixed more bugs from the pivotal stories too
any word on why they took down their demo? It was the point of reference for knowing if it was our code or the api
since last week
it is
and it works
we have included some WP VIP functions in the parent theme
because they do help with caching mysql requests
yes, we just include it in a helper file
in the parent theme
not sure if they are also in the CK theme
I agree
problem is I don’t think we have access to all the VIP functions
so we should probably just exclude the rule


Is <https://campbellswpdemo.captechventures.com/> also not working?
I understand it's the gigya session signature
What about other calls to the item list api?
Is it that endpoint only
?
I’m seeing the same issue in my local install of their demo theme
which used to work
their demo works though
YEs
I’ll get in touch with captech and ask about it
^
user id: f4ce5a1849cf4ee1afed1af3387dd44e
uid signature: yePsbMZuSiXkZn4YjzMcwmNIENM=
signature timestamp: 1473105725
I verified those are the same values from the gigya.getAccountInfo
I would guess, that is from my local install of their demo theme
it sends a POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php`
but then the Item list plugin is sending a GET
for this sample, at least
`<https://services-dev.campbellsoup.com/ItemList/api/collections/type/1/f4ce5a1849cf4ee1afed1af3387dd44e?userId=f4ce5a1849cf4ee1afed1af3387dd44e&amp;UIDSignature=rLsrSbDJWhfUZWtvEkKadDra%2BHs%3D&amp;signatureTimestamp=1473106937>`
I have another weirdness
I just tried to get collections via their demo theme on my local
and I get the signature error
but then browsed to <https://services-dev.campbellsoup.com/ItemList/api/collection/default/2/f4ce5a1849cf4ee1afed1af3387dd44e?userId=f4ce5a1849cf4ee1afed1af3387dd44e&amp;UIDSignature=SVarFlJlO%2BOzE8C0eWEd5dIKCk4%3D&amp;signatureTimestamp=1473108453>
(taken from the plugin log)
and I get a good response
well
not anymore
<https://services-dev.campbellsoup.com/ItemList/api/collection/default/2/f4ce5a1849cf4ee1afed1af3387dd44e?userId=f4ce5a1849cf4ee1afed1af3387dd44e&amp;UIDSignature=J1yWOiDwGmddcdMhx2cDvMslqms%3D&amp;signatureTimestamp=1473108544>
I got it working
I mean
I just got a good request response
only thing different is that I got the signature and timestamp from the <https://accounts.us1.gigya.com/accounts.getAccountInfo> and then used it on that post body
It’s weird, the requests fail with the plugin, but if I copy paste the request URL into postman, they work
see:
maybe a server time issue?
maybe services-dev is a bit into the future and that’s why the first request doesn’t work?
(time difference check)
I don’t think it’s a timezone issue, it uses the linux epoch time
That’s what I mean
the server time on the C# server
test case: I modified the get_collections() in the plugin
and added a sleep(10);
and that request works, and enables the `&lt;3 Favorite` button
yes
it would have function docs
I think
I just tried and it worked
function add_collection_request()
I tried with create collection and get_collections
now I added a filter
for all wp_http::request();
to wait 5 seconds
seems to work
cool
you’re welcome
ok
ok, I have a fix for the ajax issues
it’s for the reviews plugin
I’m making a PR
update: the PR was sent to CSC-IT
:slightly_smiling_face:
that soudns good, I’m currently working on that, so I have a pivotal guide to check :slightly_smiling_face:
<https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-campbells-kitchen-theme/pull/335>
jenkins is not checking builds after a new commit
we need to comment “retry” now
is that new expected behavior?
that should be good
thank you!
is the hardcoded recipe id and name at <https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-campbells-kitchen-theme/pull/335/files#diff-5287fb9614e793b3dcb300fc876850d2R243> so we can test for now?
cool, what do we need to use the actual recipes ids?
ok, so why are we using hardcoded ids?
the `recipe-id` should be the same everywhere, regardless of the environment
were you using $post-&gt;ID ?
you’re using `&lt;input type="hidden" name="recipe-id" class="recipe-id" value="&lt;?php echo esc_attr( $post-&gt;ID ); ?&gt;”&gt;`
it should be
`&lt;input type="hidden" name="recipe-id" class="recipe-id" value="&lt;?php echo esc_attr( get_field( ‘recipe-id’, $post-&gt;ID ) ); ?&gt;”&gt;`
we should make it a variable available at the beginning of that file
so we can use it anywhere
instead of many calls to get_field
Also, I am running their demo locally
and it only works with that filter
so the answer is yes, if we copy their demo and run it locally, we get the same issue, unless the filter is used
I just tried the demo
and it worked
without the filter
let’s wait for  to try it on his CK
maybe :smile:
now it didn't
ha
:9
oh nevermind
it doesn’t work
me too
it is
we are just passing the timestamp we get from gigya
we are not generating it
or anything like that
it’s failing for all on my local demo
trying with <https://services-dev.campbellsoup.com/ItemListLegacy/api> . . .
yes
same error
ok
I was excited because the API was working
just saw the email that they disabled validation for now :disappointed:
well, at least we don’t need to `sleep()` now


for the comments on your PR, would you make those changes or do you want me to work on it? if so, we can move those points to separate pivotal stories, and merge your PR now
Ok
Recipes have a specific logic for the order the tags are displayed, so we still need to make the separate ajax calls.
where are you trying?
what page?
You need to activate the item list plugin
?
whooo earthquake
and  : <https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-plugins/pull/21>
it’s because it’s special
whe whe whe
mine should be up to date
What's Swanson?
Is it the son of the Swan?
Like Odinson
can any of those be marked as started/finished/delivered? <https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/1557199/search?q=label%3A%22favorites%22>
<!here|@here> I just merged into csc-develop, so in ~20 minutes your updates should be in devcsc
any of you sending anything else to devcsc soon?
?
doesn’t seem to work for my user either
<https://devcsc.wpengine.com/campbells-kitchen-2/favorites/>
should be working now
They are in the pfw-wp-plguins repo
I’m dancing in the rain
hahaha
ok
I’ll probably be done with my tasks between today and tomorrow, and Bruce seems to be soon done with the Favorites
The gigya bugs are the ones that worry me
ok
I can see that :stuck_out_tongue:
just fly here
<https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-campbells-kitchen-theme/pull/388>
what do you mean placeholder?
Ah yes
You're right
It can be updated in the reviews settings
Add it Emily

it should say where it faile
d
ok
ok, it’s an error related to the fix Dax made
looking at it
have you received any emails from jenkins?
ok, deployments are back to normal
cool
ratings &amp; reviews will be acting weird until that PR arrives at devcsc
they already merged the PR at pfw-wp-plugins
so we’re halfway there
ejcron
I did too :stuck_out_tongue:
:smile:
yep
I’m delivering the safari related tasks now
I delivered some bugs regarding the safari JS
and finishing some about ratings &amp; reviews
I just sent your updates on ck theme to devcsc, so you can mark them as delivered :smile:
mat huh?
matching?
Topics are no longer pages
They should be edited on Posts -&gt; Topics
Only the "Kitchen Guide” is a page
<https://devcsc.wpengine.com/campbells-kitchen-2/wp-admin/edit-tags.php?taxonomy=topic>
no
topics are now terms
on the Topics taxonomy
:stuck_out_tongue:
whee
where is it lingering?
plis
it should be working fine for everyone now
as of this afternoon
I think that was a waste of time, if you spent a full day working on something that could have been done within an hour by Daniel, Dax or me. There’s more important tasks you can work on: Edit collection names, custom collections view, fix remove from favorites and some other bugs.
Yiiiiiiii
<!here|@here>
latest changes going to devcsc now
they are the same
but do use preview-dev
<https://services-dev.campbellsoup.com/ItemListLegacy/api/collections/type/1/75c58d8543b74b6983241c1d4e148d70?userId=75c58d8543b74b6983241c1d4e148d70&amp;UIDSignature=3nMRGLAhjT%2BS3VdT535uQ8GGNSI%3D&amp;signatureTimestamp=1474494558>
the legacy item list API is returning 404s
:s
have you heard about any possible work from them?
(the non legacy API is working fine)
mentioned the delete collection endpoint is not working, we could ask about that too
is the endpoint responding correctly?
it isn’t working on myCollections.get()
404
on the legacy api
<https://services-dev.campbellsoup.com/ItemListLegacy/api/collections/type/1/75c58d8543b74b6983241c1d4e148d70?userId=75c58d8543b74b6983241c1d4e148d70&amp;UIDSignature=pHuikGG9RpxrFk40aL0aASBeLfo%3D&amp;signatureTimestamp=1474495733>
&lt;h2&gt;404 - File or directory not found.&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;h3&gt;The resource you are looking for might have been removed, had its name changed, or is temporarily unavailable.&lt;/h3&gt;
looking at it
<https://services-dev.campbellsoup.com/ItemListLegacy/swagger> returns 404 too
^
everything
checking :smile:
apparently we don’t have recipes related with the prego brand
<https://devcsc.wpengine.com/campbells-kitchen-2/wp-admin/edit.php?brand=prego-174&amp;post_type=recipe>
it is supposed to get recipes that have the “Prego®” term in the Brand taxonomy
yes, something messed with that counter
but it looks like there aren’t any
however, something must be wrong
I’m looking at the API and it says there’s 16 recipes with that term
I’ll try importing them
see what happens :smile:
uhmmm, the brands are there, and have the correct term assigned to them
I’ll look more into it and let you know
<https://devcsc.wpengine.com/campbells-kitchen-2/brands/prego/>
recipes are there now
I tried reimporting, but found the issue is the missing user-rating in a bunch of recipes
the temp fix was to go into each recipe and save them, so at least an empty value is stored, and makes them display
we had a pivotal story for this, let me look for it
<https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/124972621>
This will cause recipes to not appear in recipes grids and collections
even if they match the criteria
I can see swagger
<https://services-dev.campbellsoup.com/ItemlistLegacy/swagger/ui/index>
and “Help"
<https://services-dev.campbellsoup.com/ItemlistLegacy/Help>
<!here|@here> has anyone received a jenkins build failed email?
it
it’s taking too long for updates to show up on devcsc
say it Emily!
I’m finishing the user location for the reviews, then I have a quick task for the profile page
I think most of the pending work is blocked by the item list api not working
whut!
nice
I just tried <https://devcsc.wpengine.com/campbells-kitchen-2/favorites/> and got the same 500 error
do I need to change anything?
ah, well, Duy said he’s working on it
hopefully it will be done today
how much do you think you can progress without it working?
looks like we’re not getting the item list api back today
I think we’re almost done
the item list API is back online
I updated the csc-develop branch on pfw-wp-plugins, so we can start using the new version of the plugin
haha
<https://devcsc.wpengine.com/campbells-kitchen-2/favorites/> works for me
if you’re talking about your local, then you need to get the updated item list plugin from the pfw-wp-plugins repo
and also make sure you have entered the gigya api key in the User SSO settings in WP Admin
cool
Can you do a last pass on the reviews features on cscrain, hopefully there won’t be any more bugs, and we can push it to CSC-IT
when you forget to push to devcsc :stuck_out_tongue:
I fixed that one over the weekend it should work now
This 2 are very important and CapTech should look at them:
<https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/131038915>
<https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/131037985>
I am
:smile:
I’ll start by replying on his email
Let me look
is fixing that
you would have to test everything on preview-dev
(as you’re supposed to)
I’m working with Duy on that on the phone right now
but it’s mostly, that only new users will have that working correctly
previous users got subscription data corrupted
you’re guelcom
we did find a bug
I’m logging it on pivotal now
<https://devcsc.wpengine.com/campbells-kitchen-2/wp-admin/edit.php?occasion=halloween&amp;post_type=recipe> displays 1 too
recipes were last imported on the 23
without override
please hold a few minutes
I want to make sure we fix the external products too
we would have to import everything back
into devcsc
yes, it’s just work, but the idea is that we should be able to import/export between environments
yes we can
we should be able to
we would need to add another conditional field
so we use a taxonomy field or url or page
depending on the option
there’s no field that supports them all
it should display all the recipes tagged with the term
<!here|@here> let’s go ahead and re-migrate
I think it will fix the external products issue
yeah
remember to do the dance
with overwrite
:scream:
and now we have meal time and meal time 2
whee
let me check something first
something weird *is* happening
<https://devcsc.wpengine.com/campbells-kitchen-2/wp-admin/post.php?post=6041&amp;action=edit>
it is returned on the API as a halloween recipe
but it’s not selected there
same for <https://devcsc.wpengine.com/campbells-kitchen-2/wp-admin/post.php?post=6103&amp;action=edit>
that one has no occasions selected at all
no
they should be gone
only the parent pages `/guide/` and `/topics/` should be there
I ran a migration
that only migrated occasion -&gt; halloween
and it worked this time: <https://devcsc.wpengine.com/campbells-kitchen-2/wp-admin/edit.php?occasion=halloween&amp;post_type=recipe>
there’s something weird with this migrator
not sure
those are from the “related recipes” taxonomy
we need to choose again the terms on those slides
yaaay
I sent the the update to devcsc ~10 minutes ago
so it should be there in ~20 minutes
<!here|@here> I’m running the migration on devcsc, this should fix the missing external products
cross your fingers!
actually, I was removing all external products
for some reason, we had around 300 duplicated
same title and id
migration is running now
I’m not sure 1 will be needed in production, let me check if there’s duplicate external products there
yes, step #1 is required
I don't
I first thought those were from the related recipes taxonomy
Those integer seems to be coming as tags
but also get added in the category taxonomy
was it funny to see us running like crazy people?
haha
it should be
it stuck on Migrated 1900/1950 records...
the API apparently took to long to respond
and it timed out
I tried deleting categories with integers
and they came back on this migration
running it again . . .
ok
I’ll delete all the `int` categories
and try again
Migrated 650/700 records...
so far no new int categories
it finished on ours
Tell him he should not use more than 50 for the batch
anything more than that and it will stall, because the API is too slow
then 20?
I did it with 50 this time, but I’ve had to use 20 some times
should not be anymore
I just deleted them
as in
I *just* deleted them
seconds ago :slightly_smiling_face:
wheeee
Yes
just waiting on you to send the update for the meal mail registration signup
before sending everything to devcsc
aah
dulce
looking at it
we have an issue
The taxonomy `Brand` is being confused in WP Queries with the `brand` post type
yes
looks like
I’m digging further
that’s why this link: <https://devcsc.wpengine.com/campbells-kitchen-2/wp-admin/edit.php?brand=swanson-174&amp;post_type=recipe>
returns no recipes
but we know they are there
it’s easier to do #2
but then the brands would need to be recreated
please hold
I’m checking some things
yes, that would work
just let me check one little thing
ok
we’re good
we don;t have to rename it
my tax_query wasn’t working because I didn’t have `popularity-score` on my recipes
BUT it is the reason why that link in the admin returns no recipes
<https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-campbells-kitchen-theme/pull/504>
it’s get_field
ah
no
nevermind
checking
preview-dev or preview?
they should be working fine on <https://preview-dev.campbellsoup.com/kitchen/profile/>
preview should not work
there are no screensets specified for it
<https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-campbells-kitchen-theme/pull/510>
?
please edit that page
fill in the missing categories
preview-dev is the place
preview doesn’t have latest content nor code changes
we have to delete them after the import
untill we figure why they are coming in, in the first place
:thumbsup:
I think now those need to be re-entered after the migration
the migrations plugin does not keep the IDs
no, it’s just that breakfast is the first one on the list
<!here|@here> can I get an update of what everybody is working on right now?
let mi si
he didn’t do anything wrong
<http://campbells55.wpengine.com/campbells-kitchen-2/wp-admin/post.php?post=4092&amp;action=edit>
problem is that the migrations just delete and create new terms
instead of checking for already existing ones
so previous relations are messed up
we need to make sure we’re updating that info again
anything that links to taxonomies/terms
should be updated
do you have the latest from staging?
<https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-campbells-kitchen-theme/blob/staging/single-recipe.php#L103-L112>
that should prevent the error you’re getting
I don’t think we have access
in production
yes, but we either get access
or ask them to do it
was that happening for all the users? I know it happened for users created before Daniel and I fixed the optin-csc.js code
yes
it also does it for new users
those store that data differently
cooking level is sent as formData
I can see the data is being sent wrong
working on a fix
wp-admin on devcsc seems to be down
ok
I’m almost done with the optin fix
can you take a look at the brands pages on devcsc and fix the recipes slide filters?
not from a quick read on the code
why do you think that’s happening?
oh yes
that happened for me too after changing the field to a repeater
it would go up to hundreds
I had to delete those slides (because it would take too long to delete each repeater)
and recreate them
(on my local)
is that the reason they’re not loading?
As in, if they load after some time, we should wait for each to load, delete the recipe grid slide and create a new one
Yes
Menu mostly, I think
yes, if it’s not loading, there’s no other option: Import from another WP install, or recreate them manually
yes
<https://console.gigya.com/site/partners/UserManagement.aspx/User#/details/id/c7bf847bf2b042c6809613b139c513f8/identity/all>
yeah, in the optin-csc
I’m almost ready to push to dev
sounds good
update: my local version is now saving the data in the correct fields all the time, I just have to solve a tiny issue with the newsletter signup. I’ll get ready now and head to the office. la calor está juerte
I am
Can you share the settings on the slide so I can test and debug?
Ok
They are
All values are stored as strings
So a lot of casting needs to be done
And not much indexing we can do
ok
We were looking at that the other day, the CDN seems to be ignoring the cookies sent to it
I’ll make a change to fix that
can you please log it on pivotal?
:disappointed:
yes
~30 minutes
ok
I have a fully working csc-optin
:tada:
yes
that is the issue
it’s showing the rating instead of count
:slightly_smiling_face:
deal
^
I’m testing it locally right now
ok
will do
I’m just making sure the query is not running an OR for everything
and we end up with dinner recipes that are not necessarily pace
just a quick change on your PR
<!here|@here> all the latest changes have been sent to devcsc, please update pivotal :slightly_smiling_face:
yep it will
I’m getting “service unavailable” errors from Sprinklr
/giphy wheeee
for the last hour
I thought it was the slow internet over here

Grab a soup
checking
looks like CDN is not passing cookies for GET nor POST
the request seems to be going through fine, just without cookies
so the “user not logged in” response is not cached
is just not receiving the cookies
uhmm
nevermind, it’s not working on devcsc either now
checking . .
yes, I think it was because I used http, not https
yes! works on devcsc
so I’m back to my cookies are missing theory
I could add some debugging code and push it to devcsc, to check if cookies are being received
ok
looks like I was right about cookies not being sent on the CDN
{"success":false,"data":{"message":"Session cookie does not exist.","cookies":[]}}
“cookies” is populated with $_COOKIES
is there anything we can do? or only CSC-IT?
have you checked <https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-campbells-kitchen-theme/pull/532> ?
thank you!
I’m sending to devcsc now
any updates on the CDN issue?
The only difference is that this request relies on cookies. The others don't.
`gigya-profile`
yes
yes, for the “Recently viewed recipes"
it is generated with siteID_postTYpe_hits
so if they choose to “track” other post types in the settings, that has to be whitelisted too
thanks
dulce!!
it is
I’m sending the PR to remove the debug code now
no?
URL?
I can see the text
screenshot? it looks fine to me
not below, on the right
and it’s there
one sec
so you’re right
it does not appear if you’re logged in
^
it’s the other way around
if you *are* logged in: text and button dissapear
if you are *not* logged: text and button are there
(that’s how it’s currently working)
the idea is that if you’re logged in, the same text and button should appear
but the button should take you to your profile
No I didn't
checks failed on that PR
cscDisplayError
whee
noo
:
Mario Delgado [12:05 PM]  
 the idea is that if you’re logged in, the same text and button should appear (edited)

[12:05]  
but the button should take you to your profile
all tags should come prioritized from `get_recipe_tags()`
also, the cookie whitelisting also needs to be done on production
if they are using different API keys and URL, yes
let me check
campbells55 is using <https://commerce-api.sprinklr.com>
devcsc is using <http://prod0-commerce-api.sprinklr.com/|prod0-commerce-api.sprinklr.com/>
so yes, there can be different content
ok
I think we have a couple of PR we want there
just one more push from  and we shall be good
I’m on it
one sec
it says there’s 19504 reviews
I see a review for <https://preview.campbells.com/kitchen/recipes/chicken-mozzarella/>
but it doesn’t come on the page
actually, it should have 45 reviews
that’s what the API is returning
the problem is in the Sprinklr API
the sort parameter breaks it on production
but works fine on the staging api
Ok
nevermind that one
yes
`createdTime`, `reactionPositiveCount`,`rating`
and their `-` variances
on both cases, it would be the slow taxonomy queries
sprinklr sometimes takes a while to respond
and the response is needed in the middle of the recipe detail page, to render the reviews box
wheee
and we just got Dax’s update :disappointed:
<https://bitbucket.org/campbellsoupco/pfw-wp-plugins/pull-requests/16/open-terms-and-conditions-link-in-a-new/diff>
WHOOOO
ful URL <https://preview.campbells.com/kitchen/>
just so you don’t freak out if you click on Steven’s link
yes
I’m heading home
will be online when I get there
yes!
I saw the email and tested a bit
wheeee
if any of you get an email from jenkins, it’s CSC-IT’s jenkins complaining about or PR, please forward it to Steven and me when you get them.
the emails are sent to <mailto:esm_web_services@campbellsoup.com|esm_web_services@campbellsoup.com> and the person with the commit/PR
so we need to make sure forward
thanks!
We only use acf pro. The user api and faq plugins do use piklist too
Click
Something must be breaking the Js
?
I just created a new account
it worked fine with no favorites yet
worked fine after favorite
trying with a collection now
works with a collection too
we are talking about <https://preview.campbells.com/> right?
<https://preview.campbells.com/kitchen/>
let me find an already created usr
I had one other user in that env, it had no favorites yet, but the loading gif doesn’t stay
added favorites and collections
still works
are you still getting that?
any failed requests?






OMG OMG OMG
/giphy hello
I have a few hours in front of the computer
let me know if I can help with the gigya issue
can you paste here the logs from those API calls?
I mean, the complete log
URL, parameters, response
yes
ok, that’s for the `admin-ajax.php` request
can you paste the one from the item list plugin logs?
I’m about to
so there’s nothing on your `debug.log` or `http_requests.log` inside the item list plugin foldeR?
Yes, please go to wp-admin -&gt; settings -&gt; item list api
and set debug to “Yes"
any chance we can get a few test users imported? so we can trouble shoot the newsletters issue
what’s the URL to the pivotal ticket?
thanks
I can’t seem to replicate the favorites issue
it works as expected
maybe it’s with some specific recipes
I’m guessing we have recipes imported that they don't
(as in, we import from production, and they import from staging or dev)
<!here|@here> creating collections from <https://preview.campbells.com/kitchen/favorites/> is broken
when was it fixed?
maybe the fix is not yet pushed to prod?
let me check on my dev
ok, makes sense
<https://preview.campbells.com/kitchen/recipes/sweet-potato-casserole/>
I get:
recipe ID would be `9901`
the request to add to collection returns OK
but it’s not really added
I think it’s safe to say, it’s something on the Item List API end
interestingly
once the recipe exists in the favorites, if we try to add it again to the collection, it works
^^^ with those two logs entries, you can have a call (or email) with Duy
The first request is made when the recipe detail page is loaded. If you click on add to favorites and add a collection. The response (second snippet) returns OK
But the recipe is not added to the collection
BUT if you go back to the recipe detail page. The first request works. And adding to a collection works too.


:party_parrot:
Party Parrot!
haha
actually almost 13 years :disappointed:
ok
thank you
do we want to manually updated the reference to the images?
in the custom fields
otherwise is resyncing, with overwrite
and re-publishing all the recipes
I assume that, if the image was renamed (or the meta data didn’t exist for some reason on import), and it’s correct now, it should come correctly in our next overwrite import
the recipe image urls aren’t there, for that recipe
so most likely, the info wasn’t there on import
I’ll check if the API (where we import from) has it
the info is there now
I mean the info is on their API
it’s missing on WP
so I propose we either enter those values manually
or re-import
nope, we have to reimport everything
that’s why I suggest manually entering it
I’m doing it
I assume it’s currently cached
<https://www.campbells.com/kitchen/recipes/vietnamese-pho/>
doesn’t show it
but
<http://campbells55.wpengine.com/campbells-kitchen-2/recipes/vietnamese-pho/>
does
should be around ~5 minutes?
not sure if we have a way to clear it either
so
let’s wait ~10 minutes?
I’m assuming they ran the import for those new recipes?
did they?
ah
ok
nevermind my direct message :stuck_out_tongue:
hhahaha
why does he look like Fish Mooney?
/giphy Fish Mooney
<https://www.campbells.com/kitchen/recipes/vietnamese-pho/>
I’m looking at some php errors Steven wrote us about
ok, I’ll check in ~1 hour
wait what?
I understand we should stick to legacy
just use the dev
instead of staging or production
<https://services-dev.campbellsoup.com/ItemListLegacy/api>
that’s the dev env he’s talking about
prod would be <https://services.campbellsoup.com/ItemListLegacy/api>
staging would be <https://services-staging.campbellsoup.com/ItemListLegacy/api>
so we just have retry, and send him the logs from debug.log
and http_requests.log
from the plugin folder
Ok
I’m not sure what changes have happened, but the bug on <https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/1557199/stories/131919201> seems to be resolved
I tried many times now and it’s working
can you please double check?
on production
and preview dev too,
please point  to them so he can double check
that’s better
thanks!



<!here|@here> I updated the coding standards on the CK theme, if you work on it, make sure to pull the latest

ok
I got the same message
:omg:
probably
I don’t think it was
but I was gone for a while, so  ?
you requested that one
do you remember why?
uhmm
ok
Dax remembers that it was in the initial designs, but then it was removed
so it all makes sense

that's great news
I was expecting 2 dozens

wow
cool
Ok

yes
I can
yes, makes sense
I have the product locator
but I understand they're going to check until Monday anyway?
ok
I'll check those ajax requests then
are the cache headers required in the ajax request too?
as I did for the favorites page
Ok
ok

I am
But I don't have a fix yet
the new fixes are in preview-dev
one doesn't have `campbells-`
:stuck_out_tongue:
gigya-profile3
gigya-profile
yes
yes
I'll disable the tracking for them
there's settings for it
on the wp admin
done
pretty much that, store the session data in local storage
and send it in the request parameters
to the AJAX request

=/
I thought there were sets of rules, and each could have 10 parameters
they are merged
:slightly_smiling_face:
Yes!
thank you
we are not using it anymore

Unless you meant schedule changes?
You can set content to go live at schedule time. But not changes to a page or post. Does that make sense?
Nope, the homepage already exists.
Only new page/posts can be scheduled.
yes
a la orden
me neither
well
I just joined
I have one last change I'd like to push before that
I'm pushing it now
a bug fix on the signature refresh when it's too old
<https://github.com/mediarain/pfw-wp-campbells-kitchen-theme/pull/609>
:parrot_dad:
do you mean reviews  ?
Ok
Ok
let me check
(if they were on pivotal)

:open_mouth:
just pushed to devcsc the fixes for favorites, should be there in ~30 minutes
devcsc has the latest now
preview-dev
I sent my last PR for pfw-wp-plugins ~30 minutes ago
that would mean we have fixed all favorites and R&amp;R bugs
Ok
Ok
Ok will do as soon as I get home. Driving.

<http://blog.parse.com/announcements/what-is-parse-server/>
Yes
It’s their open source alternative
<https://eng.uber.com/go-geofence/>

it removes them by default
it addes them later, when you call the_content()
it applies the the_content filter to it
what shortcode?
did you define it?
ok
do you have it like this?
`echo apply_filters('the_content',get_the_content(`?
it’s not supposed to enter a &lt;p&gt;
yes, when the filters applied
it should
because if you have multiples `\n` without a space, it trims them
also check: <https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wpautop>
the filter is there by default
did you try using the_content() (even if it breaks things) to check if the &lt;p&gt; get added?
then there is a plugin or code in functions removing it
is <https://wordpress.org/plugins/tinymce-advanced/> installed?
I usually find people using that plugin, breaking that kind of stuff
did you check for the wpautop on both parent and child theme?
can I see the repo?
includes/shortcodes.php?
I’m sorry, I had to leave
did you fix it?
<https://github.com/mediarain/cmnh-us-website/blob/master/public_html/wp-content/themes/shadow-us-dancemarathon/single.php#L133>

merge databases sounds interesting
"The 'merge databases' feature sounds like either a sweet victory of immutable data that makes life easier all around OR something truly horrible that never should have been born.
If these guys have solved the WP devops problem, they will be millionaires and candidates for canonization."

"Alex from kite here. Re privacy: we totally agree that it's a legit concern. when we started working on this we realized if we wanted to index tens of thousands of libraries, we wouldn't be able to ship the entire index along with the client. Hence the cloud-based architecture. We've thought a lot about privacy and written up our thoughts here: <http://www.kite.com/privacy|www.kite.com/privacy>. The short answer is: we don't index anything on your computer that you don't explicitly ask us to, and our plan is to earn trust the hard (i.e. only) way: transparency, published policies, and a track record of good decision making."
I like that thinking :simple_smile:
Does Kite offer an on-premise option?
Kite does not have any plans to add an on-premise offering at the moment. If you are interested in an on-premise or AWS co-managed installation of Kite servers, please email <mailto:onprem@kite.com|onprem@kite.com>.

Is anybody taking care the less compiling grunt/gulp?
*of
let's go with less
can you setup grunt?
and commit it on github
cool : )
BTW, I'm working on the login page
I just merged it
merged
I'll start working on index.php now
I'll try to replicate the grid css
so we can all use it
Those are over complicated for what we need, they have small-6 big-8 and stuff like that, I'll just try the bootstrap approach, a single .column-4 that's just 100% when in mobile
etc
Yaaay
Merged
I commited a basic grid .column-1 .. .column-12
with their width %
and I will add whatever else is helpful with the grid while I'm working on the index
Someone please check and merge : )
yeah, maybe we should
you're working on transactions.php, right?
I'll start with payment-center then
<!channel>: BTW
When I reimplemented the grid, I did leave the page wider
it was 100px;
*1000
It's 1140 now
should I set it back to 1000?
990px
ok
sorry for the mix up
but they are also very basic style, so they can be used anywhere
ok, I will move them under &lt;article&gt;
will do now
for Messenger.js, are we going with the Flat theme?
I'll test it then, and see if it doesn't mix with the background too much
I think
you should remove the default search box
and just leave the modal
because custom search is hand made php and javascript with datatables
I have used it a lot
BTW, Currently working on the hotkeys
Did we intentionally kill the inputs outlines? or is it result of the reset?
yes
I see it in the reset
I'll edit to &lt;a&gt; only
instead of leaving the default browser outline?
ok
I'm a bit lost now, what should I work on next?
Ok
I will work on a sample template.php that summarizes all the elements (grid, form styles, tables)
yes
a sample of the grid
a sample of the three-column layout (as seen on payment-center.php)
a sample of every field type
a sample of a datatable
so its easier to just copy one element you're going to use
Ok
you are welcome
Also, I just noticed we don't have styles for h1,h2,h3,hetc
ok
margins?
ok
hahaha
Ok

I think so,  ?
Until I finish my tasks I think
Joaz is
that's on the code side
I assume whoever approved my pull request made sure it was right
It was a code styling issue
I only have a couple of IE bugs to catch
I was waiting for the search color box to be finished, and missed the commit that included it, but it's done now
I think I can get them this morning
so it's down to one IE bug
Ok
can someone please merge this ASAP?
and then  can you update dev so it can be tested?
thanks :simple_smile:
kewl
it seems to be fixed :simple_smile:
I'll just wait for   to confirm
no
colorbox is a lightbox, like the one for the search
yes
I am
it'll be up in a few minutes
I think we're just missing a responsive issue?
I got a task for Social Dental today
yes
Ciik
*Cool

only the contact form in the home, which has a select which determines the address it should send it to, is not ready in rain forms, for the other forms, it should work fine

Ok
hey <!channel>
I just did a quick implementation on rain forms
on the form builder
in a &lt;select&gt;

the email will be sent to that address, if "become a client" is selected

I’m still on week 1 :smile:
<https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12553967>
```One of the moments where I really started to feel like I was starting to 'see the matrix' was when I was working on a regex engine to try to make my compiler faster (it didn't, but that's another story). The asymptotically fast way to approach regex processing actually involves writing a parser to process the regex, so in order to write a fast compiler, you need to write another fast compiler to process the regexes that will process the actual programs that you write. But, if your regexes get complex, you should really write a parser to parse the regexes that will parse the actual program. This is where you realize that it's parsers all the way down.
When you think more about regexes this way, you realize that a regex is just a tiny description of a virtual machine (or emulator) that can process the simplest of instructions (check for 'a', accept '0-9', etc.). Each step in the regex is just a piece of bytecode that can execute, and if you turn a regex on its side you can visualize it as just a simple assembly program.```
how is everyone else doing?

try with disk utility
It can “Restore” dmgs
Yes, Disk Utility can do this. Use Convert then select your dmg file. In the Save As dialog that follows, select DVD/CD master. Disk Utility will insist on saving the new ISO as a .cdr file, but it is really an ISO. You can rename it to .iso in the Finder, if you like.

At <http://osxdaily.com/2012/07/18/convert-dmg-to-cdr-or-iso-with-disk-utility/> there are screen shots that walk through this process.
(convert to .iso)
and then use DD?
"A way to convert a .cdr to an .iso is:

$ hdiutil makehybrid -iso -joliet -o [filename].iso [filename].cdr"
or .dmg to iso
using hdiutil too

and you get to translate
practice your english
that sounds so fancy
i’d buy her coffee
she doesn’t drink it
wants to go
it’s settled
discusss it over DM
Guys, if anyone is thinking about going, you should, I had a super time. I’m not going because I have a boring family commitment I can’t shake
off
thanks yuliya
I *really* appreciate it
but that’s like dessert
will you provide dinner too?
somebody please teach yuliya to use ellipsis correctly
we should all go after work to yuliya's
so we can make dinner
with whatever is in her fridge

Here
looks right
jquery was enough
for soooo long
Angular was cool
too bad they decided to just piss off everyone who learned it
I went like 10 times to the backbonejs landing page
read a few lines
and then logged in to fb
haha
I built a stripped to the bones clone of <http://close.io/> with angular and twilio
it was cool
I sometimes think of opensourcing it
but then I want to sell it
hahaha
yeah
do you want to buy it for $1?
it IS
you lost it!

<!channel>: yuliya is buying lunch on friday at Zhu
yea
sure
yuliya will pay on friday
I’ll give her money later
:wink:
that doesn’t make sense
in any case
it should be you guys congratulating me
so yuliya pays
and you can give her some money
if you want
Yuliya, it’s Nicaraguan costumes that the white person pays
so pay
you never invited us to anything
so rude
yes you are little
and white
I can’t think of any
that is work related
this is work
not friendship
don’t mix things yuliya
be professional
those are friendship based
:wink:
only as a human being
haha
yeah
you guys go
I’ll come by a bit late
but just in time to pay the check
:wink:
#olakease
how do you say priviet? if it doesn’t have an i?
:O
or maybe an actual shooting range
:smile:
I don’t understand
are we celebrating yuliya is leaving?
if so, shouldn’t we celebrate *after* she’s gone?
so it’s all agains her?
I don’t care about your UEFA
I was going at 2

I don’t think they allow kids in the shooting range
but it’s Nicaragua
so maybe
what is a poloygon?
they do
people shooting at them is a better experience?
it will hurt
paintballs hurt :_
:slightly_smiling_face:
it still hurts
haha
that sounds like a shooting range
but less fun
why would you limit their fun?
yuliya-free day?
WHEEEEE
/giphy yay!
I can’t do that and work at the same time
:disappointed:
how? I get those shake-to-charge-phone things and charge $ for charging people’s phone?
Hahahahahaha
moral of the fable: always bring your phone :stuck_out_tongue:
you’re right
that sucks
you should bake one
and invite me
lets bake cake at Yuliya's
Ah?
I came bring the cake mix
Ok

I used once
it had a lot of magic functions that made me crazy because I couldn’t find them on the documentation
it was slow
and themes were crazy
but that’s just the opinion of a WP guy
haha
what?
show me one
in the WP core
I would find functions like get_product_by_label($label);
but `product` and `label` where magic parts of the function
so you would not find that function defined or documented anywhere
maybe it made it easier for people who was more familiar with it
but it required lots of digging
nope
I’m talking about actual non existing code

you better hope one of us is near if there's a fire
that's why I said "is near"
not sure if I want to giphy that
?
why?
you want to take advantage of those super 0.01% discounts on ironing tables?
isn't it better in cyber monday?
anyway, that's something you can do on your phone while saving somebody from the fire
or jumping between balconies
isn't it a *fire* rehearsal?
that's what I expect
you and you?
OK
I take both your words
try put
I'm not against it
I said you can do both

maybe like 80% of the thing

Ok. Is there a design for it ready?

Yes I am
Did you get some test emails last night?
You should have received some emails from the reviews
at <mailto:yuliyak@mediarain.com|yuliyak@mediarain.com>
please check the spam folder
Ok, that may be because it's running on my local server and for some reason it's not able to send email.
So if you want, you can come here and I will show you how its working
Before we can upload to live
And test there the emails
<http://www.socialdental.com/api/review?companyID=6570>
^^
it is
it appears that there isn't a google profile set
one sec
No
This is on the web side
that company (Rain development) doesn't have a google plus profile set
that's why it links to the same page
Yes
Merged
and changes live
mas peor

As we just discussed, yeah, let's add them as optional parameters
Ok
guardian_extra
yes
server side, the signature is first uploaded to S3 before sending the email
we can do the same with multiple signatures

click
Ok, thanks!
I confirm some of the files (the untracked ones) are from the latest work by
and me
for the media release and the reviews
But here are wordpress changes that I wouldn't know
*there
:simple_smile:
I'm finishing the SSO for Bloom
Then I will move to the PDF
I still have to find where the watermark is
Nevermind, Jose just led me to it
I'll work on it as soon as I have Bloom done




the php upload size limit is not letting users upload videos
(it's currently set to 8mb)
they are if they are 8mb or less
*they are uploaded
My concern is the overall file size for long videos, there's a good chance people will have to wait a while to watch videos from the media releases
Implementing some kind of compression on the videos
And reducing the size
would help
it's not the length of the video
it's the file size
if it's over 8mb, the server will reject it
it's VERY easy to lift that limit
but I'm a bit concerned of people uploading 500mb videos for X reason
A very long video, maybe an hour? It depends a lot on the quality, which I can't really predict
To maybe 10 minutes?
Would they really need more than that?
Okay, I just tried to lift the limit but I don't have the permissions on the server
The one with root access must do it
*someone
cool
but that needs to be implemented in the app
So according to  , a 10 minute video would be 600mb. Which will definitely take time to download for the user
We can compress the videos for web display, amazon has a service for that
But it's one more fee for the client
In the mean time, I have a fixed media release page that will work for the currently uploaded videos
which I could also upload, with the PDF feature
you can check my last comment on Pivotal
Ok
We also need to lift the max upload size in the php.ini
I tried but I don't have file permissions
Any feedback about the PDF?
Ok
I have a commit ready for PDF generation, video playback in media release, and adding extra signatures and guardians in media releases (and the pdf)
any word from the client? so I could go ahead and push this live, so  can test his code for the extra signatures/guardians
As in the last sample I sent you?
Are the tasks in pivotal in priority order?
?
I'm implementing a color background on the PDF header, and then it will go live
If client isn't joining I think slack is fine
We have pivotal too..
could it be twilio downtime?
So they appear as undelivered in twilio?
What does it show then?
if it's videos, then it may be the max upload size bug we are having
depends on education, location and mood
I just received sms for photos and video media release
We lifted the upload file size limit
Can you please fordward one?
(y)
:thumbsup:
Did you not use msn messenger?
Stop living under a rock :stuck_out_tongue:

Thanks
+1 on circleCI
I used it before and it's beautiful
video upload shouldn't have issues
please wait
let me add some code to see exactly what the app is sending
Why not create a google apps account + google voice number?
please use my phone 8646747747 so we can see if the second sms arrives
1st text only
lol

I should be finishing tomorrow morning
both the request review API
and the new page
I'm doing the frontend
it was ready but not approved
:stuck_out_tongue:
what API call is it?
I just tried it on the iphone 6 and worked fine
Is it possible to get a google voice number with google apps? That way we see the SMS in the email
Mine does
:simple_smile:
Is that google voice # linked to the group email?
Ah ok, then yeah, we should get one for the group
Well, it worked with my personal google voice
It's not like that
I think the mobile app should make a /session/ call
so the server can return if the cookie stored in the mobile app is expired or not
if its expired/invalid, you display the login form again
No, but it can happen, if server is restarted, the session can get lost
We can set the cookie to never expire, but it doesn't mean the actual session won't expire
They aren't for most of the time
The cookie you receive and store, is set in the user's table, as a token
when you try to login again, it looks for that token on the table
if it doesn't exist
then the rest of your API calls fails
because  you are not testing the session
<https://www.socialdental.com/api/session>
returns the session status
I said you are not checking the session, but I'm assuming that
Yes, that's what I'm suggesting
The issue here may be mostly, multiple people using the same user
The "remember me" token is re-generated in every new login
So that expires any previous cookies/sessions
That is manegable
We implement a sessions table
Instead of a field in the users table
Two stories then, #1 check session on active app. #2 enable multiple sessions per user
I think session checking is a more generable bug/feature
I got one text only
let me check what the server received
the PDF generation was failing when a client didn't have a logo/watermark
I got both too
I've fixed various bugs so yes I've had deployed manually to /api too
Yes we can
But I'm adding support for both
Yes we can
It's back up
It's fixed now
The router expected a /:hash

Mario Delgado [10:12 AM]
For now I added support for / with a Get parameter

Mario Delgado [10:12 AM]
I'll make it more sane now
I changed the files structure a bit, to clean up the users.php, but only the /review should actually be affected
Multiple sessions, yes
I'm adding the story right now
We do all our math in roman numerals in Nicaragua
We use fingers too, two fingers means V
lol

what if I have small feet?
Does the distance chance?
oh, that makes sense
but it must be very funny to see people measuring how many feets they walk
do people watch closely to make sure the step is right next to the other?

Ok
No
Not the new version
I'm almost done
I think 1 hour
is now testing the new reviews flow in the dev server
what is the expected functionality of the share buttons at the end of the flow?
^^
I don't remember google+, but on facebook, there is no way to predefine the text anymore
awesome
Yes we can. Just one thing
so the android version opening google maps works now with the button, BUT the url scheme for google maps has to be a /maps/place link in order to work
for example: <http://www.google.com/search?q=social+dental+utah&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;client=safari#istate=kp:xpd&amp;amp;lrd=0x874d90061976d467:0x119cf7a17ab23094,2,5|www.google.com/search?q=social+dental+utah&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;client=safari#istate=kp:xpd&amp;amp;lrd=0x874d90061976d467:0x119cf7a17ab23094,2,5>
I can programatically replace "search" with "maps"
and opens just fiiine on iOS
but it won't on android
this one works: <https://www.google.com/maps/place/Social+Dental+LLC/@40.281648,-111.686217,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x874d90061976d467:0x119cf7a17ab23094>
It's a Google Place URL
so, for tomorrow, and the client's demo, it will work fine if it's on iOS
but for android, they would have to get that right for every client
Ok
so I'll push live now and test it personally
I'll share you a link in a minute
Yes
<http://api.socialdental.dev/review?companyID=5704>
test from an iphone
Ok
<http://api.socialdental.dev/review?companyID=5704> doesnt work?
oops
wrong link
:simple_smile:
<http://socialdental.com/api/review?companyID=5704>
that one should do
Yes, first one is my local dev
you don't have google maps installed?
ok
not with the social dental LLC example
because of the URL
"the url scheme for google maps has to be a /maps/place link in order to work

It's a Google Place URL"
Yes, that should work
But Android seems to be a pain
For example, it worked perfectly yesterday on my galaxy s5
using the window.open()
I updated chrome last night
and today it didnt work anymore
/giphy ha ha
I have lost my faith on giphy
It works as long as the URL is correct
I'm still working on it, will report soon
stop shutting it down then

My code works as long as the right URL is in place
Ok
ON IT!
hasn’t finished the integration. But it will tag you regardless of branch, so you’ll still have to check
jose is writingt
everybody leave!
done
lets test!
oh well, I guess you can’t have everything in life
the tag doesn’t work 100%
but at least you can see the branch
from here
its live
you can try it
(please) try it
YAY

I did not update the old API
no
I guess not
I will have to update the old api
lovely


ok
is it opening with chrome or “internet” ?
doesn’t matter. it works with the default browser on my phone
It.opens Google maps
I have to test with that device specifically
Is the client reporting issues with any other devices?
Ok. Sounds good.

and the “fix signature in PDF"
No table yet
Ok
If we could have a clean list of tasks that are *required* for today and tomorrow, it would be best
Ok
On android it is sending them to the fallback form on timeout.
The Google maps redirect is working now on the same nexus Francisco was using
^^
is there any other report of the maps not working?
I played around, but nothing concrete to be honest.
One thing I did note was that francisco was testing an invalid url
therefore, there was no google maps url
the url reported on te story worked every time
*the story
the only one that didnt work from the phone’s browsing history was
<http://api.socialdental.com/review?companyID=Yml>
so the problem there is that we don’t have a 404 for that kind of stuff
that worked every time
I did play with the javascript, but nothing major
it’s basically the same
I also tried with both “Internet” and Chrome
on the same device

that isn’t finished yet
Daniel finished the html templates
But they aren’t implemented yet
:simple_smile:
AFAIK
Daniel only built the html templates
but didn’t implement them
right?
you need them online?
I guess I will
can’t they paint it so it looks pretty?
my father went to russia
to train
he said it was cold
:simple_smile:
one?
I have only seen one, used by
social dental’s office ip
for <http://api.socialdental-dev.mediarain.com|api.socialdental-dev.mediarain.com>
yes
ok
Yeah,  said he will take care of it tomorrow
you can try it now on the ipad
* the iphone
yes
<http://api.socialdental-dev.mediarain.com/review?companyID=9386>
ok
Ok
can we make it actually tag/mention francisco?

5704 has fb
Ok
thanks
:simple_smile:
Yes we can. If we are sure fb and Google work on both ios versions
^^
fb worked on both?
I'm trying but I can't access the DEV server from home -.-
^^

that is the issue
I have been uploading manually to /api
I’m on it
I think so, yes
/giphy tears

WHY?
/giphy giphy is wrong
HAHA

Ok
On it
Both facebook and google worked fine on ios
It just tested it again after your last change, it works
Yes
But not to the old api
done
Ok
Works

I assume code needs changing?
I understand urls are hardcoded
It's http:// for Dev
are the API urls hardcoded in the app?
is it something like `API_URL + ‘/media-release’` ?
or the full url is in there?
I don’t have access to that repo
I think :simple_smile:
yes it is
you should be able to
I understand that’s what they have done
What HTML email are you trying?
ok

That’s when doing POST to /media-release in the dev API
BTW, I use <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman-rest-client/fdmmgilgnpjigdojojpjoooidkmcomcm> to make HTTP requests
haha, it failed
are you getting any emails at all?
no, there are bugs  has to fix
seems to be a path issue
she’s referring to the new html emails, and we want to make sure the test build is using the dev api instead of production
can you check that please?
with your debug tool
Only new server :disappointed:
yes, the “admin” subdomain isn’t working yet
what do you get?
<https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/technotes/App-Transport-Security-Technote/>
yes
that’s the bug  will work on
cool
please compile it and install it in a device for them to test
^^
I think he needs to be included in the group?
<mailto:socialdental@mediarain.com|socialdental@mediarain.com>
yes


Did bruce fix them?
we can, everything working fine on dev?
Yes
Ok
I deployed last night
/giphy wheeee
Can I get any hint of the error?
<http://api.socialdental.com|api.socialdental.com> and <http://socialdental.com/api|socialdental.com/api> are practically mirrors, except from the html emails
however, I think  changed the deployment to also deploy to the old server
so there shouldn’t be any differences
yes
and it is getting deployments from master too
right?
what went wrong?
ah ok
yes
but that’s old server
app is pointing to new server
is it because of the spaces on the image url?
but why didn’t it fail before?
I think Steven will be done by the time you end up getting it
:smile:
we should make 42 the limit for everything
is it campbell’s?
I prefer marucha
n
I want maruchan right now
MARUCHAN
¬¬
what is social dental?
Julia, do you have my message from Luigi?
os !
how do you capture a photo? is it like capturing a pokemon?
I don’t have an UI test, sorry
but thanks for the message
no
and 5 of them are comments?
What? He’s here?
I feel exposed now
It will send you a production url
like <http://dentalvisitreview.com/xyz|dentalvisitreview.com/xyz>
and you should be able to visit at <http://api.socialdental-dev.com/review/xyz|api.socialdental-dev.com/review/xyz>
url?
(checking)
(one sec)
that review request was made on the production server
I’m importing to the dev server
BTW, that shouldn’t return a slim error, it should return a “we can’t find the review request"
maybe put that story on pivotal?
Julia, please check: <http://api.socialdental-dev.mediarain.com/review/Kr8Y>
Yes you have to be
And your ip probably changed now
Andres
:smile:
<!channel>: has anyone uploaded manually to the old api server?
<https://github.com/mediarain/SocialDental-Slim-API/compare/someones-changes>
are those your changes?
ok, please use that branch to add it back, via git
jenkins now uploads to the old server too
and manual uploads break it
and master
/giphy bye bye!
haha yes
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
:’D
nope
I saw you placed the story on pivotal
Looks like he did
?
Ok
de rien
of course, it’s always the API
¬¬
:stuck_out_tongue:

looks like there an issue with twilio’s ssl certificate
the certificate seems to be valid
so it looks like us
that certificate uses TLS 1.2
I think the SSL error is about the parent certifciate, something on thawte’s side
NSURLErrorFailingURLPeerTrustErrorKey=&lt;SecTrustRef: 0x7b669f60&gt;,
the certificate at <http://api.twilio.com|api.twilio.com> uses sha-1
that’s why it is failing, according to jose’s info
Ok. Let me check
I'll check as soon as I'm there.
I'm at the doctor right now
there isn’t any company in infusionsoft with <mailto:tom@socialdental.com|tom@socialdental.com>
that’s why there’s no company ID nor company name
still checking
Still trying to figure out why it isn’t loading it
do you have the url?
of the review request
Please
there’s no google URL on that profile
var yelpUrl = '';
    var googleUrl = '';
    var facebookUrl = '';
this one says scott miller dds
<!channel>: did anyone change the login procedure? On yuliya’s case, the company ID for the review request is 238. but that’s only a contact, it should be linked to the company (236), which has all the correct profile data
Getting coffee right now
I’m trying to trace the issue
I have reverted your commit because it was causing the issue with the company info
profiles links should be working now
but it breaks pretty much everything else
what did it fix exactly?
wow
so this is actually worse?
yeah
I reverted because I wasn’t aware of the other issue. And this seemed important
and mostly because I haven’t been in social dental lately
where was the other bug happening?
did it happen at login?
oh ok
one sec
can you please test both bugs?
ok
oquei
yup
can you please elaborate?
how are you preloading the data?
what api function?
not the ids
<https://www.socialdental.com/setup-password/?id=11090> should be loading the contact’s email
right?
how does it load it?
<https://github.com/mediarain/socialdental/blob/dev/wordpress/wp-content/themes/SocialDental-Main/page-change-password.php> ?
Ok
what’s the password for <https://www.socialdental.com/setup-password/?id=11090> ?
I mean, the email
well
I just used that form
to change the password to “olakease"
it said success
and I just logged in
no, it should not prepopulatye
there’s no code doing that
it only preloads if you do <https://www.socialdental.com/setup-password/?email=brucel@mediarain.com>
I don’t see how, that code hasn’t been changed
in months
it worked only when you used <https://www.socialdental.com/setup-password/?email=brucel@mediarain.com>
instead of the contact id
oh
it’s true
<https://www.socialdental.com/setup-password/?id=6>
but there’s no code for that
AND
I’m looking at an old repository
so, it’s not preloading
but the password change does work
I don’;t have access to the wordpress’ current repository
so that’s as far as I can go
I think I got what I need
just letting you know that there’s nothing to let you know
I’m kidding
see: <https://www.socialdental.com/setup-password/?id=11090>
yup
/giphy runaway
there you go. I think I deserve a brownie
what kind of candy?
throw me one, but not to the face
:stuck_out_tongue:
don’t worry, I’ll share some of my brownies on friday
like, 2 out of the 12 brownies I’m expecting
moar brownies
why fridays?
I want wednesday brownies
they can be found at the supermarket
also, there’s olive oil
I just saw it
I can take a picture if you want
there you go  !!
Let’s go  !
:’(
no
they are going to cafe las flores
lol
ok
we’ll wait!
???
Ah oo
Ok
can it wait after my campbells scrum?
scrum is at 11.30
ok
going to now
everything looks great
if it’s ready, I’ll go ahead and merge it
one sec
there it is
what isn’t working?
exactly
uhm
ok



it looks like there is an error
yes
after I finish something with campbells
I need the iphone
who has it?
!
josé thinks maybe the user doesn’t have the facebook app installed
and is doing the auth via the web browser
therefore, when the session is closed on web, it closes the social dental session too
or maybe she’s bored
and wants to talk to people


but, did it ever work?
did you ever see it working?
yay
don’t worry, there’s no way it could work
not yet
there’s still one
yes, eventually there will be a multi-universe war
jose dies
and social dental doesn’t exist
all bullets comming
and jose says “no"
trying to stop them with his mind
but they hit them anyway
*him
2 of 3 dentists recommend social dental?
lol
yes
ok
please try fb and google now
ok
thanks
yw?
Yeah whatever?
:stuck_out_tongue:
/giphy yeah whatever
ok
ok
ios 9?
yay
but those are two different tests, right?
yay
beautiful
wait
that means that ios 9 is able to send the sms
the app
maybe they upgraded the ssl
cool
can you try weird stuff?
yeah
something that can make it fail
did it not work?
ios 8 and 9
Ok


/giphy YAY!
Yes
that is on the plan I’m building
Ok
<!channel>: user for test account has been changed to <mailto:nottom@socialdental.com|nottom@socialdental.com>
He didn’t want to receive the emails
same password

Lol
proxy?
does
ok
I do
and I talk too fast
so it makes sense
:stuck_out_tongue:
Hey José Someone, finish the teaching!
yay
so it works!
ok
yes José, you should fix it
/giphy jose
That guy?
you haven’t even seen him
don’t be so close minded
the interstellar guy did OK
comparing to the christmas ghosts movie



That’s why I shared the google doc
you can see the new api endpoints there
Hi José, you can see the new endpoints in the google doc I shared with you. Yo can also comment if you need anything different or new :simple_smile:
^^
yep
HAHA



Yes
please see: <https://github.com/mediarain/SocialDental-Slim-API/commit/eba6dd2a3fe3ab81dc38824b55156050c1fbcb8f>
No we don’t, but I could
just store in the DB
and only try again if the facebook url changes
ok, will do that
no?

yeah, but what settings?
aaah
